# Lesson 1.2: File Exploration

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - SCENARIO INTRODUCTION:**
The student chose a scenario in Lesson 1.1. You remember which one. Read the file at `scenarios/[CHOSEN-SCENARIO]/company-context/SCENARIO.md` and use it to introduce the scenario to the student.

Write a 3-4 paragraph intro that:
- Sets the scene with energy and immediacy ("Alright, NOW we enter the scenario.")
- Tells the student who they are, where they are, and what organization/business they've just joined or taken over
- Hints at the mess they've inherited and the challenge ahead (the previous person left things in disarray, there's a deadline, the stakes are real)
- Ends with a sense of excitement — this is their problem to solve now

Keep it conversational and punchy. Match the tone of someone saying "Here's the deal — things are wild, but that's exactly why they hired you." Do NOT copy the SCENARIO.md verbatim. Paraphrase and add personality.

STOP: Ready to see what you inherited?

USER: Yes

## Explore the File Structure

Let's see what you're working with.

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - FILE STRUCTURE LISTING:**
List the actual contents of the student's scenario folder at `scenarios/[CHOSEN-SCENARIO]/`. Also mention the shared root-level support folders.

Present it as a file tree or organized list. For each item, give a brief plain-English description:
- `company-context/` — Background info on the organization: who they are, how they communicate, and the situation you've walked into
- `inherited-chaos/` — The mess left behind by whoever came before you. Notes, data, research, half-finished work
- `templates/` (root level) — Document templates for creating reports and updates
- `organized/` (root level) — Empty folder where you'll put your organized work
- `analysis/` (root level) — Empty folder for analysis outputs
- `reviews/` (root level) — Empty folder for reviews and feedback

List the actual folder and file names you find — do NOT make them up. If there's an `attachments/` folder at root level, mention it too.

Here's what you've got to work with. The key folders are `company-context` (the background info) and `inherited-chaos` (the mess you inherited).

STOP: See the structure? Let's dive into the company context first. Ask me to summarize the company context for you.

USER: Summarize the company context for me

## Read the Context Files

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - CONTEXT FILE SUMMARY:**
Read ALL THREE files inside `scenarios/[CHOSEN-SCENARIO]/company-context/` and give a conversational summary. The three files are SCENARIO.md, BRAND-VOICE.md, and a third overview file (its name varies by scenario — just read whatever the third file is).

Structure your summary under three bolded headings:

**Your Situation:** Summarize the student's role, what happened before they arrived, their deadline, and what's at stake. Keep it vivid and specific to their scenario.

**The Organization/Business:** Summarize key details about the organization — what it does, its history, current state, size, and any important metrics or facts from the overview file.

**How They Communicate:** Summarize the brand voice — the tone, personality, audience, and communication style. Note why this will matter as the student starts creating documents later.

After the summary, teach the meta-skill:

"Notice how I just read multiple files and gave you a summary? You could do the same thing with any folder of documents — contracts, research papers, meeting notes. Just point me at them and ask for a summary."

STOP: Any questions about the company context before we peek at the chaos?

USER: Responds

## Peek into the Chaos

Now let's peek into the inherited chaos. What's in here?

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - INHERITED CHAOS LISTING:**
List the actual contents of `scenarios/[CHOSEN-SCENARIO]/inherited-chaos/` and describe what you see. Read the folder structure, name each file and subfolder, and give a brief description of what each one likely contains based on its name.

After listing everything, comment on the overall state of things — the mess, the scattered information, the half-finished work. Build anticipation: "We'll dig into all of this in the next lesson."

STOP: Ready for the key insight about working with files?

USER: Yes

## The Cowork Advantage

Here's what makes Claude Cowork powerful:

In a regular chatbot, you'd have to copy-paste content from each file. With Cowork, I can:

1. **Read any file** you've shared with me
2. **Read entire folders** of files at once
3. **Create new files** and save them for you
4. **Search across files** to find specific information

All you have to do is describe what you want. I handle the rest.

STOP: This is the core superpower — you talk, I do. Want to see it in action?

USER: Yes

---

## Demonstrate File Creation

Let's create a quick test file to see this in action.

STOP: Ask me to create a file that summarizes what you've learned so far about your scenario.

USER: Create a test file summarizing what I've learned

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - FILE CREATION:**
Create a file called `organized/getting-started-notes.md` with a summary based on the student's chosen scenario. Include:
- The organization/business name and what it does
- The student's role
- The core problem or challenge they're facing
- The deadline and stakes
- A brief inventory of what's in the inherited-chaos folder

Pull all of this from the files you already read. Make the summary clean, scannable, and useful — like notes you'd actually keep on your desk during week one of a new job.

Done! I just created a file in your organized folder. Take a look at it.

This is how we'll work together throughout the course. You describe what you need, I create it.

STOP: Did you see the file I created?

USER: Yes

---

## Changing Folders (Quick Reminder)

One more thing before we move on. Remember: you can always switch which folder I'm working with.

**To switch folders:** Just ask! Say something like:
- "Can you work with my Documents folder instead?"
- "I want to switch to a different project folder"
- "Access my Desktop folder"

I'll show you a folder picker, and you can navigate to whatever folder you need.

This is useful when:
- You want to apply these skills to YOUR files (not just the course)
- You're working on multiple projects
- You need to reference files from different locations

STOP: Make sense? You can always switch folders whenever you need to.

USER: Yes

## Wrap-up

**Meta skill:** Exploring unfamiliar file structures and understanding what you're working with.

**Where else this applies:**
- You inherit a project from a coworker who left — messy folders, no documentation. Claude can map it out and explain what everything is.
- A client sends you a zip file with their "brand assets" — 17 folders, inconsistent naming. Get oriented in minutes instead of hours.
- Your own Downloads folder has become a graveyard. Point Claude at it: "What's in here? What can I delete?"
- Starting a new job and need to understand how the team organizes their shared drive.

**Next up:** In 1.3, we're going to actually dig into that inherited chaos. You'll learn how to extract insights from messy documents, synthesize patterns across folders, analyze images, and pull in web research. We're going to start uncovering what's really going on in your scenario.

STOP: Ready for 1.3?

USER: Yes / let's go

## Important Notes for Claude

- **Actually read files**: When summarizing company context, read the actual files from the student's chosen scenario and give real summaries. Do NOT make up content or fall back on generic descriptions.
- **Discover dynamically**: Each scenario has different file names, organizations, roles, and challenges. Read the files and respond to what you find — do not assume any specific scenario.
- **Create real files**: When demonstrating file creation, actually create the file in organized/. Base it on the student's specific scenario.
- **Folder switching**: Emphasize how to switch folders — this is key for Cowork users.
- **Keep it conversational**: This is exploration, not heavy analysis yet. Save the deep dives for Lesson 1.3.
- **Remember the scenario**: The student's chosen scenario carries through the entire course. Reference it naturally and consistently.
