## The Todo List

You may have noticed a todo list appearing on the right side of the screen during our work.

This is one of Cowork's built-in features. When I'm working on multi-step tasks, I automatically create a todo list to track progress.

**Why it's useful:**
- You can see exactly what I'm working on
- You know how far along I am in a complex task
- It keeps both of us organized

**You can also ask me to create todos:** If you have a list of things to work through, just tell me and I'll add them to the todo list.

STOP: Have you noticed the todo list during our sessions? Pretty handy, right?

USER: Yes

## Conversation Tips

Here are some tips for getting the best results from our conversations:

**Be specific about what you want:**
- "Summarize this file" → Good
- "Summarize this file focusing on action items and deadlines" → Better

**Tell me about your context:**
- "I'm preparing for a meeting with leadership"
- "This is for a customer-facing document"
- "I need this to be casual and friendly"

**Ask for what you actually need:**
- If you want a document, say "create a document"
- If you want analysis, say "analyze"
- If you want options, say "give me a few options"

STOP: These tips will help you get better results from me (and any AI tool). Make sense?

USER: Yes

## Asking Follow-up Questions

One of the best features of working in conversation is iteration.

You can always:
- Ask me to **expand** on something: "Tell me more about that third point"
- Ask me to **redo** something differently: "Can you make that shorter?" or "Try a more formal tone"
- Ask me to **combine** things: "Merge that with the earlier analysis"
- Ask me to **save** something: "Save that as a file called recommendations.md"

Don't settle for the first response if it's not quite right. We can iterate until it's perfect.

STOP: This is how real work happens - back and forth until it's right. Ready for more tips?

USER: Yes

## Working with Multiple Files

When you need me to work with multiple files, you have options:

**Describe them:**
- "Look at all the files in the customer feedback folder"
- "Read the scenario file and the company overview file"

**Reference specific files:**
- "Read the handoff notes file in inherited-chaos"
- "Look at the CSV in inherited-chaos"

**Reference outputs from earlier:**
- "Use the synthesis you created earlier"
- "Combine that with the leadership update"

I keep track of what we've done in the conversation, so you can reference earlier work.

STOP: The key is just describing what you want clearly. I'll figure out how to do it. Make sense?

USER: Yes

## When to Start Fresh

Sometimes it helps to start a new conversation:
- When switching to a completely different project
- When the conversation has gotten long and confusing
- When you want a "clean slate" perspective

But often you'll want to **continue** the conversation:
- When building on previous work
- When iterating on a document
- When the context is important

There's no wrong answer - just think about whether the previous context helps or hurts.

STOP: In Cowork, each conversation is a fresh start. This is different from Claude Code's CLAUDE.md memory feature, but it also means no baggage from previous sessions. Ready for the next tip?

USER: Yes

## Clarifying Questions

I'll sometimes ask you clarifying questions before diving in. This is intentional!

For complex tasks, I want to make sure I understand:
- What format you want
- Who the audience is
- What the goal is
- Any constraints or preferences

**You can also ask ME clarifying questions:**
- "What information do you need to do this?"
- "What would make this easier?"
- "What else should I consider?"

Good collaboration goes both ways.

STOP: Feel free to ask me questions too! This is a conversation, not just you giving orders. Ready for the final tips?

USER: Yes

## Pro Tips for Cowork

A few more power-user tips:

**1. Be explicit about outputs:**
- "Create a Word document" → I'll create a .docx file
- "Make a spreadsheet" → I'll create an Excel file
- "Give me a presentation" → I'll create a PowerPoint

**2. Ask for links:**
- When I create files, I'll give you links to download/view them
- You can always ask "where did you save that?" if you lose track

**3. Use me for research:**
- I can search the web and synthesize information
- I can fetch specific web pages and extract content
- Just ask!

**4. Combine capabilities:**
- "Search the web for X, then create a document summarizing what you found"
- "Read all the feedback files and create a presentation about the themes"

STOP: These tips will serve you well. Any questions before we move on?

USER: Questions / No

## Wrap-up

**Meta skills you just learned:**

1. **Todo lists:** Track progress on complex tasks
2. **Conversation tips:** Be specific, provide context, iterate
3. **Multiple files:** Describe what you need, reference earlier work
4. **Starting fresh vs. continuing:** Know when each makes sense
5. **Clarifying questions:** Ask and answer them for better results
6. **Pro tips:** Explicit outputs, links, research, combining capabilities

**Where else this applies:**
- Any time you're working with AI tools, these principles help
- Being specific and providing context works everywhere
- Iteration is key - don't settle for the first output

**Next up:** In 1.5, things get wild. You'll learn about agents - the ability to spin up multiple Claude instances that work in parallel. We're going to process all those competitor files and past initiatives at once. This is where Cowork starts feeling like a superpower.

STOP: Ready for 1.5?

USER: Yes / let's go

## Important Notes for Claude

- **Todo list**: Point out the todo list feature if the user hasn't noticed it
- **Keep it practical**: These are tips, not a lecture. Keep energy up.
- **Acknowledge differences from Claude Code**: This lesson replaces the commands/navigation lesson which was terminal-specific. Focus on Cowork-native features.
- **Don't oversell**: These are useful tips, but the real power is in the doing
