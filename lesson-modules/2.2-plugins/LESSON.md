# Lesson 2.2: Plugins

You connected Claude to your tools. Now let's make it an expert at your job.

Here's the thing about Claude right now -- it's talented, but it's like a new hire on their first day. Smart, capable, eager. But it doesn't know YOUR role yet. It doesn't know the workflows you use, the vocabulary of your industry, or the kind of output you actually need.

That changes today. In about 20 minutes, you're going to install a plugin that gives Claude instant domain expertise. No training. No setup headaches. Just a few clicks.

STOP: Sound good? Ready to turn Claude into a specialist?

USER: Yes

## What Is a Plugin?

A plugin is a ready-made toolkit for a specific job function.

It bundles together everything Claude needs to become an expert in your domain -- connectors, skills, and slash commands, all in one package.

Think of it like this: instead of explaining your industry from scratch every single time you open a conversation, the plugin gives Claude the context, workflows, and vocabulary it needs on day one.

One install. Instant expertise.

STOP: Make sense so far? A plugin is basically a "job training package" for Claude.

USER: Yes / makes sense

STOP: Look through that list. Which ones jump out as relevant to your work?

USER: [Names one or two plugins]

## How to Install a Plugin

Installing a plugin takes about 30 seconds. Seriously.

You can browse and install plugins right from Claude's settings or by clicking the **+** button next to the chat box. Find the one you want and click install. That's it.

No terminal. No build steps. No code. Just a few clicks and Claude gains a whole new skill set.

STOP: Ready to pick the right plugin for YOUR scenario?

USER: Yes

---

## Match Your Scenario to a Plugin

This is where the course gets personal. Depending on your role or scenario, there's a specific plugin (or combo) that fits best.

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - SCENARIO RECALL:**

The student already chose a scenario in Lesson 1.1. Reference that choice here. Say something like: "Since you're working through the [SCENARIO NAME] scenario, I know exactly which plugin fits." Then use the scenario routing below to recommend the right plugin(s).

If for any reason the scenario isn't clear from context, ask: "Quick check -- which scenario are you working through? Just want to make sure I recommend the right plugin."

STOP: Based on your scenario, I've got a plugin recommendation for you. Ready to see which one fits?

USER: Yes / ready

---

## Your Plugin Recommendation

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - SCENARIO ROUTING:**

Based on the user's response, recommend the matching plugin(s) and explain why. Use this mapping:

- **Scenario 1 - Event Planning:** Recommend **Productivity**. Event planners live and die by task management, scheduling, and keeping dozens of moving pieces organized. Productivity gives Claude the ability to help you manage timelines, coordinate logistics, and stay on top of everything.

- **Scenario 2 - Bookstore or Small Business:** Recommend **Productivity + Marketing**. Running a small business means wearing every hat. Productivity handles your operations and day-to-day organization. Marketing helps you plan promotions, create content, and reach new customers. Together they cover the two biggest needs for any small business owner.

- **Scenario 3 - Product Launch or Tech:** Recommend **Product Management**. If you're shipping products, building features, or managing a roadmap, this is your plugin. It gives Claude fluency in specs, prioritization frameworks, sprint planning, and stakeholder communication.

- **Scenario 4 - Restaurant:** Recommend **Marketing**. Restaurants run on foot traffic, repeat customers, and word of mouth. Marketing gives Claude the tools to help with campaigns, social media content, local promotions, and competitive positioning.

- **Scenario 5 - Nonprofit:** Recommend **Productivity**. Nonprofits are stretched thin. Every hour counts. Productivity helps Claude assist with scheduling, donor follow-ups, event coordination, and keeping your team aligned without adding overhead.

- **Scenario 6 - Loyalty Program or CRM:** Recommend **Marketing + Sales**. If you're managing customer relationships and retention, you need both. Marketing covers the campaigns and engagement strategy. Sales covers pipeline tracking, outreach, and deal management. Together they give Claude a full view of the customer lifecycle.

- **Scenario 7 - Real Estate:** Recommend **Sales**. Real estate is a pipeline business. Leads, follow-ups, showings, closings. Sales gives Claude the vocabulary and workflow understanding to help you manage your deals from first contact to close.

- **Scenario 8 - Freelancer:** Recommend **Productivity + Sales**. Freelancers are their own operations team AND their own sales team. Productivity keeps your projects on track. Sales helps you manage client outreach, proposals, and pipeline. It's the solo-operator combo.

- **Scenario 9 - HR or People Ops:** Recommend **Productivity**. HR is coordination-heavy -- onboarding, scheduling, policy management, employee communications. Productivity gives Claude the framework to help you keep all of that organized and running smoothly.

After recommending, tell the user to go install it now using the **+** button or settings menu.

STOP: Go ahead and install that plugin now. I'll wait.

USER: Done / Installed it

## What Just Changed

You just leveled up Claude in a big way. Before the plugin, Claude was a generalist. Smart, but generic. Now it knows your domain.

Here's what's different:

- Claude understands the **language of your field**. It won't give you generic advice -- it'll use the terms and frameworks that actually matter in your role.
- Claude knows your **typical workflows**. Ask for help with a task and it'll structure the output the way someone in your role would actually expect it.
- Claude gained **new slash commands and skills** tailored to your function. We'll explore those in the next lesson.

The difference is night and day.

STOP: Want to test it out? Ask Claude something specific to your role and see how the response feels different now.

USER: [Asks a role-specific question or describes what they noticed]

---

## Why This Matters

ACTION: Respond to whatever the user tried. Acknowledge what they noticed, and reinforce the key point -- plugins give Claude domain expertise instantly. If they haven't tried something yet, prompt them to ask a question related to their role.

Here's the bigger picture: you can swap plugins as your role changes. No lock-in. No complexity. If you start a new job or take on a different project, just install a different plugin. Claude adapts to you.

And if you have a hybrid role, you already saw this -- you can combine two plugins to cover both sides. A freelancer who does project management AND client outreach. A small business owner who handles operations AND marketing. Claude handles all of it.

STOP: Cool, right? One install and Claude goes from generalist to specialist.

USER: Yes

---

## Wrap-up

**Meta skills you just learned:**

1. How to evaluate which tool or plugin fits your specific role -- not just picking from a list, but understanding WHY a particular toolkit matches your workflow
2. How to customize an AI assistant's capabilities without writing code -- the skill of configuring tools to match your needs translates far beyond Claude

**Where else this applies:**
- Install the Sales plugin and Claude can help manage your pipeline from first contact to close
- Install Marketing and get campaign briefs, content calendars, and competitive analysis built in
- Combine two plugins to cover hybrid roles -- like a freelancer who does both project management and client outreach
- Swap plugins as your role changes -- starting a new job, shifting departments, or picking up a side project
- Apply this same "match the tool to the role" thinking when evaluating any software, not just AI

**Next up:** In 2.3, you'll learn about skills and commands -- the specific capabilities your plugin just unlocked. You'll see exactly what new powers Claude gained and how to use them.

STOP: Ready for 2.3?

USER: Yes / let's go

## Important Notes for Claude

- **Route scenarios correctly**: Use the 9-scenario mapping above to recommend the right plugin(s) for each user. If their answer doesn't match exactly, use your best judgment to find the closest fit
- **Actually wait for install**: Don't proceed past the install step until the user confirms they've done it. The rest of the lesson depends on the plugin being active
- **Keep it practical**: When the user tests their plugin, engage with their specific question and show how the response reflects domain expertise
- **No code talk**: This lesson is about clicking install, not about technical setup. Keep it accessible
- **Reinforce the analogy**: The "new hire" framing should carry through -- plugin = job training that happens instantly
