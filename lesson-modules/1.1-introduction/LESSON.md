## Your Perfect Scenario

Based on what you've told me, I think you'd really connect with one of our learning scenarios.

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - SCENARIO MATCHING:**

Match their profession to the best scenario:

| If they mention... | Recommend... |
|---|---|
| Events, coordination, planning, admin, hospitality | **Event Planning** - "You'll rescue a community festival from chaos" |
| Retail, books, sales, small business owner, entrepreneurship | **Bookstore Turnaround** - "You'll save a struggling independent bookstore" |
| Tech, software, product, startups, project management | **Product Launch** - "You'll recover a botched app launch" |
| Restaurant, food service, hospitality, management | **Restaurant Rebrand** - "You'll figure out how to modernize a classic diner" |
| Nonprofit, education, social work, grants, fundraising | **Nonprofit Grant** - "You'll piece together a winning grant application" |
| Marketing, loyalty, customer success, CRM | **Loyalty Program** - "You'll fix a broken customer loyalty program" |

| Freelance, consulting, agency, contractor, client work | **Freelancer/Consultant** - "You'll take over three client projects at a creative agency" |
| HR, human resources, people ops, recruiting, office manager | **HR/People Ops** - "You'll untangle a startup's HR chaos before a compliance audit" |
| Unclear or doesn't match | Default to **Restaurant Rebrand** (most universally relatable) |

**Say something like:**

"Based on your background in [THEIR FIELD], I think you'd really enjoy our **[SCENARIO NAME]** scenario. [ONE SENTENCE DESCRIPTION].

The skills you'll learn apply to any work situation - we're just using this scenario to make it concrete and fun.

**Say '[SCENARIO NAME]' to get started with this one**, or say **'show me all scenarios'** if you'd like to pick a different adventure."

STOP: Wait for user to choose

USER: [Chooses scenario OR asks to see all]

## If User Asks to See All Scenarios

Here are all 9 scenarios you can choose from. Pick whichever sounds most interesting to you:

**1. Event Planning**
You're the new coordinator at Brightmoor Community Hub. The previous coordinator quit mid-way through planning the summer festival. Vendor contracts are a mess, the budget doesn't add up, and sponsors are getting angry. Can you save the event?
*Best for: Event planners, admins, coordinators, anyone who juggles logistics*

**2. Bookstore Turnaround**
You just took over Inkwell Books, a struggling independent bookstore. Sales are down, the previous owner left cryptic notes, and you need to figure out what's actually wrong. Time to save this beloved local shop.
*Best for: Retail, small business owners, entrepreneurs, book lovers*

**3. Product Launch Recovery**
MotorCity Apps launched their scheduling app 3 months ago and it flopped. You're brought in to figure out what went wrong and plan a relaunch. Scattered meeting notes, angry customers, and finger-pointing await.
*Best for: Tech, product managers, project managers, startup folks*

**4. Restaurant Rebrand**
State Fair Cafe has been a Detroit staple for 25 years, but it's stuck in the past. The previous manager tried to modernize it and left mid-project. Now you need to figure out the right direction.
*Best for: Restaurant/hospitality, general managers, anyone in food service*

**5. Nonprofit Grant Crisis**
Detroit Youth Arts needs to submit a $50,000 grant application in 2 weeks, but the previous director left suddenly. You inherit incomplete data, conflicting budgets, and scattered notes. The kids are counting on you.
*Best for: Nonprofit workers, grant writers, program directors, educators*

**6. Loyalty Program Fix**
State Fair Cafe's loyalty program is failing. Customers are confused, engagement is down, and no one knows why. Dig through the mess and figure out how to turn it around.
*Best for: Marketing, customer success, CRM, loyalty/retention roles*

**7. Real Estate Agent**
You inherit a top agent's book of business after they suddenly retire. 47 active leads, 12 pending deals, scattered showing notes, and clients who haven't heard from anyone in weeks. Figure out who needs what and save these deals.
*Best for: Real estate agents, brokers, sales professionals*

**8. Freelancer/Consultant**
You're taking over a departing consultant's client projects at Corktown Creative. Three active engagements, half-finished deliverables, unclear scope documents, and clients expecting updates Monday.
*Best for: Freelancers, consultants, agency folks, project-based workers*

**9. HR/People Ops**
You're the new HR manager at Woodward Ventures, a growing Detroit startup. The previous person left no documentation - employee records are scattered, onboarding is inconsistent, and there's a compliance audit in 3 weeks.
*Best for: HR professionals, people ops, office managers, startup operators*

## About This Course

You don't need to be technical for this course! Think about it like chatting with ChatGPT - we're just talking! The difference is that Cowork runs on your computer and can actually DO things for you - read your files, create documents, search the web, and more.

Everyone's talking about AI, but most people still haven't figured out how to make it actually improve their work, their business, or their life. That changes today.

STOP: Ready to learn how this works?

USER: Yes / Ready

---

## How This Course Works

As we go through this course, I will teach you exactly what you need to do, and you will follow along in conversation.

Not videos. Not just reading. Direct application. This is a truly unique learning experience.

This course is designed specifically for Claude Cowork - the desktop app experience.

STOP: Does that make sense? Learning by doing, not watching.

USER: Yes / Got it

## Selecting a Folder

Before we dive in, let's make sure you know how to give me access to folders on your computer.

**This is important:** Claude Cowork runs in a secure sandbox. I can only see files in folders you explicitly share with me.

**To share a folder:**
- Ask me to access a folder (e.g., "Can you access my course folder?")
- A folder picker will appear
- Navigate to and select the folder
- I'll confirm when connected

**To switch folders:**
- Just ask! Say "I'd like to work with a different folder" or "Can you switch to my Documents folder?"
- The folder picker will appear again

If you haven't already, please select the course folder now so I can see the scenario files.

STOP: Have you selected the course folder? I should be able to see folders like "scenarios" and "lesson-modules".

USER: Yes / Done

---

## What You'll Learn

In this course, you'll learn how to use Cowork for all kinds of general, non-coding use cases:
- Analyzing and organizing files
- Extracting insights from documents
- Creating professional Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files

- And much more

This module equips you with a real working understanding of how to use Claude Cowork so you can apply these skills to YOUR work.

STOP: Sound good so far?

USER: Yes

## Setting Expectations

## Important Notes for Claude

- **No fourth-wall breaking**: Never mention "the script" or that you're following instructions. Teach naturally.
- **Remember their name**: Use their name occasionally throughout the course for a personal touch.
- **Remember their scenario**: All file references should be from their chosen scenario folder in `scenarios/[scenario-name]/`
- **Scenario matching**: Use your judgment - if their job could fit multiple scenarios, pick the most engaging one but always let them choose differently.
- **Folder access**: Make sure the user has selected the course folder before proceeding. If they haven't, help them do so.
- **Pacing**: This is an orientation lesson - keep energy high but don't rush. Let students absorb.
- **If asked about prerequisites**: Reassure them - no coding, no technical experience needed. Just curiosity.
