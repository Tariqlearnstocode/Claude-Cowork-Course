## Your Scenario Story

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - SCENARIO RECAP:**

Recap the student's specific scenario journey. Reference their chosen scenario by name and summarize the narrative arc they experienced:

1. What mess they inherited (from 1.2 - the chaos they found)
2. The core problem they discovered (from 1.5 - the big insight from cross-source analysis)
3. The solution they identified (from 1.3/1.5 - the promising idea from the handoff notes that the analysis validated)
4. The deliverables they created (from 1.6 - the proposal, spreadsheet, presentation, and review feedback)

Frame it as a complete project arc: chaos → discovery → insight → solution → professional deliverables.

Be specific to THEIR scenario - use the names, problems, and solutions from their actual experience. Do not use generic language. Make them feel like the story they worked through was real and meaningful.

STOP: That's a complete project arc - from chaos to clarity to action. Ready to see your full toolkit?

## What's Different About Cowork

A quick note on what makes Claude Cowork special:

**Compared to ChatGPT/Claude.ai chat:**
- Cowork actually runs on your computer
- It can read and create real files
- It can search the web and access pages
- It can run parallel tasks with agents

**Compared to Claude Code (terminal):**
- Cowork is designed for non-developers
- No terminal commands needed
- Visual, friendly interface
- Same core capabilities, different wrapper

The skills you learned here transfer to any AI tool. The concepts are universal - only the interface changes.

STOP: You now have skills that 99% of people don't. Ready for the closing?

USER: Yes

## Module 1 Complete

**You crushed it.**

You've analyzed chaos, discovered a core problem, and created professional deliverables - all using Claude Cowork. You now have real skills you can use TODAY.

But here's the thing -- everything you did in Module 1 lived inside your computer. Local files. Local folders. You're about to change that.

**Next up:** Module 2 is where it gets real. You'll connect Claude to the tools you already use every day -- Slack, Notion, Google Calendar, and more. You'll install plugins that give Claude deep expertise in your specific role. And you'll build a real workflow for your actual job -- not a practice scenario, YOUR work.

Module 1 taught you to work WITH Claude. Module 2 teaches you to EXTEND Claude. Everything changes.

STOP: Ready for Module 2? Just say "start lesson 2.1" when you're ready to begin.

## Important Notes for Claude

- **Celebration tone**: This is a victory lap - be genuinely excited for them
- **The toolkit table**: Present it nicely formatted
- **Engage with their response**: When they say what they want to try next, actually engage with it
- **Module 1 ending, not course ending**: This is the end of Module 1, NOT the end of the course. Frame the closing as a milestone, not a farewell. The student should feel accomplished but excited for what's next.
- **Bridge to Module 2**: The final section should build anticipation for Module 2. Mention connectors, plugins, and building real workflows. Make it feel like the best is yet to come.
- **No mention of vibe coding**: This course doesn't include the coding module
