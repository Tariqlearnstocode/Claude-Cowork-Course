# Lesson 2.3: Skills & Commands

You installed a plugin. Now let's see what it actually gave you.

Your plugin didn't just add a logo to a menu somewhere. It loaded Claude up with two things: **skills** and **slash commands**. One works automatically. The other you trigger on demand. Together, they're what turn Claude from a general assistant into a colleague who already knows how your team works.

STOP: Ready to see the difference?

USER: Yes

## Skills: Claude Just Knows

Skills are domain expertise packed into your plugin. Think of them as cheat sheets Claude reads behind the scenes.

When you ask about something in your field, Claude draws on these skills automatically. You don't type anything special. You don't activate them. They're just... there.

Here's an example. Say you installed a sales plugin and you ask Claude to help with a proposal. It already knows your team's best practices for structuring proposals. You didn't have to explain them. It just knows.

That's a skill at work. Background knowledge, always on.

STOP: Notice how that's different from just asking a general AI for help? With skills, you skip the whole "let me explain my industry" step. Make sense?

USER: Yes, that makes sense

---

## Slash Commands: Your Shortcuts

Slash commands are the other half. These are specific workflows you trigger by typing a command.

They follow a pattern: `/plugin:action`

Here are real examples across different roles:

- `/sales:call-prep` -- prepare for an upcoming sales call
- `/sales:pipeline-review` -- review and prioritize your pipeline
- `/marketing:brief` -- create a marketing brief from scratch
- `/marketing:campaign-plan` -- plan a full campaign
- `/data:write-query` -- write a SQL query in plain English
- `/finance:reconciliation` -- reconcile accounts step by step
- `/legal:contract-review` -- review a contract for risks
- `/product:write-spec` -- write a product specification

You don't need to memorize these. Just type `/` and see what's available.

STOP: See the pattern? Plugin name, colon, action. Simple. Try typing `/` right now -- what do you see?

USER: [describes what they see after typing /]

---

## The Difference

Let's make this crystal clear.

**Skills** activate automatically. Claude gets smarter just by having them. You won't even notice they're working -- your answers just get better.

**Commands** are explicit. You choose when to trigger them. They kick off structured, multi-step workflows designed for specific tasks.

Both come bundled with your plugin. Skills are the knowledge. Commands are the actions.

Think of it like hiring someone experienced. Their skills are everything they know from years in the field -- that's automatic. Their playbooks and checklists are the commands -- you ask them to run those when you need them.

STOP: Skills = background knowledge, always on. Commands = structured workflows, on demand. Got it?

USER: Got it

## Try Your Commands

Time to get hands-on. Let's run 2-3 slash commands from the plugin you installed in 2.2.

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - EVENT PLANNING (Productivity plugin):**
Suggest these commands:
- `/productivity:plan-project` -- to start planning the festival
- `/productivity:task-breakdown` -- to break a big task into manageable steps
- `/productivity:weekly-review` -- to review what's on your plate

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - BOOKSTORE TURNAROUND (Productivity + Marketing plugins):**
Suggest these commands:
- `/productivity:plan-project` -- to plan the turnaround strategy
- `/marketing:brief` -- to create a marketing brief for the bookstore
- `/productivity:task-breakdown` -- to break the relaunch into steps

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - PRODUCT LAUNCH (Product Management plugin):**
Suggest these commands:
- `/product:write-spec` -- to write a product spec for the next release
- `/product:prioritize` -- to prioritize the feature backlog
- `/product:roadmap` -- to draft a product roadmap

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - RESTAURANT REBRAND (Marketing plugin):**
Suggest these commands:
- `/marketing:brief` -- to create a rebrand brief
- `/marketing:campaign-plan` -- to plan the launch campaign
- `/marketing:content-calendar` -- to build a content calendar for the rollout

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - NONPROFIT GRANT (Productivity plugin):**
Suggest these commands:
- `/productivity:plan-project` -- to plan the grant application process
- `/productivity:task-breakdown` -- to break the proposal into sections

- `/sales:outreach` -- to draft a proposal for a new client

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - HR / PEOPLE OPS (Productivity plugin):**
Suggest these commands:
- `/productivity:plan-project` -- to plan an onboarding program
- `/productivity:task-breakdown` -- to break a hiring process into steps
- `/productivity:weekly-review` -- to review open positions and tasks

Based on your scenario, here are 2-3 commands to try right now. Let's start with the first one.

STOP: Pick one of the commands I suggested and type it. Let's see what happens.

USER: [types a slash command]

---

## First Command in Action

ACTION: Run the slash command the student typed. Walk them through the structured workflow it kicks off. Point out how the output is already tailored to their domain -- the terminology, the structure, the questions it asks are all role-specific.

Notice what just happened. That wasn't a generic response. The workflow was built for your role. The questions it asked, the structure it used, the terminology -- all of it came from your plugin.

That's the difference between a general assistant and a colleague.

STOP: Pretty different from just typing a question into a chat box, right? Try another command.

USER: [types another slash command]

---

## Second Command

ACTION: Run the second slash command. Again, highlight how the workflow is structured and domain-aware. Compare it briefly to the first one -- different command, different workflow, same domain expertise underneath.

Two commands, two completely different workflows. But both understood your context without you having to explain it.

That's skills and commands working together. The skills gave Claude the background knowledge. The commands gave it the structured playbook.

STOP: Want to try one more, or are you feeling the pattern?

USER: [tries one more or says they get it]

---

## The Aha Moment

ACTION: If the student tries a third command, run it. If they say they get the pattern, acknowledge that and move to this section.

Here's what just shifted.

Before this lesson, Claude was a smart generalist. You could ask it anything and get a decent answer. But you had to do the work of explaining your context, your industry, your format preferences -- every single time.

Now? Claude already knows. The skills handle the background knowledge. The commands handle the structured workflows. You just... work.

This is the moment where Claude stops feeling like a general assistant and starts feeling like a colleague who already knows how your team operates.

STOP: Feel the difference? This is what plugins unlock. And we haven't even customized anything yet. Make sense?

USER: Yes

---

## Quick Reference

Here's your cheat sheet:

**To discover commands:** Type `/` in the chat and browse what's available.

**To run a command:** Type the full command like `/marketing:brief` and hit enter.

**To use skills:** Just ask questions normally. Skills work in the background automatically. You'll notice the answers are sharper, more specific, and use the right terminology for your field.

**To see what's in your plugin:** You can always ask Claude "What skills and commands do you have from my plugin?" and it will tell you.

STOP: Bookmark that mental model. Skills = automatic. Commands = on demand. Type `/` to explore. Ready to wrap up?

USER: Yes

---

## Wrap-up

**Meta skills you just learned:**

1. **Skills vs. commands:** Know the difference between background knowledge (automatic) and structured workflows (on demand)
2. **Slash command pattern:** `/plugin:action` -- the universal format for triggering commands
3. **Discovery:** Type `/` to see everything available to you
4. **Domain awareness:** Plugins make Claude's output role-specific without you explaining anything

**Where else this applies:**
- Any time you need a structured workflow for a recurring task, check if there's a command for it
- When Claude's answers feel generic, it might mean you need a plugin with the right skills
- The `/` discovery pattern works across all plugins -- install a new one and immediately see what it offers
- Understanding skills vs. commands is essential for customizing plugins in the next lesson

**Next up:** In 2.4, you'll customize your plugin. Right now it's built for a generic version of your role. You'll teach it your company's terminology, your team's processes, and your brand voice. That's when it goes from "colleague who knows your field" to "colleague who knows your team."

STOP: Ready for 2.4?

USER: Yes / let's go

## Important Notes for Claude

- **Scenario awareness**: Use the CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS blocks to suggest the right commands for each scenario. If the student's scenario isn't clear, ask which one they chose in 1.1.
- **Commands may not exist literally**: The slash commands listed are illustrative. If a specific command doesn't exist in the installed plugin, adapt by showing the closest available command or explaining what the command would do conceptually.
- **Don't over-explain**: Let the student experience the commands rather than lecturing about them. The doing is the teaching.
- **Highlight the shift**: The key moment is when the student realizes Claude's output is domain-specific without them having to explain anything. Make sure that lands.
- **Skills are invisible**: Don't try to "demo" skills in isolation. Just point out when an answer draws on background knowledge the student didn't provide -- that's a skill at work.
- **Keep energy up**: This is a fun lesson. The student is seeing their plugin come alive. Match that energy.
