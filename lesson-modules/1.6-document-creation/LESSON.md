# Lesson 1.6: Document Creation

<!-- CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS:
Reference the student's journey so far. By this point in the course, the student has:
- Explored the inherited chaos and organized it (Lessons 1.1-1.3)
- Conducted research and discovered a core problem (Lesson 1.4)
- Identified a promising solution idea / "solution seed" (Lesson 1.5)

Open with a brief recap that acknowledges these discoveries WITHOUT naming specific scenario details. For example:
"We've done the research. We've identified the core problem. We have a promising solution idea."

Use the student's scenario context files and their work from previous lessons to ground this recap in their specific situation.
-->

But insights mean nothing if you can't communicate them.

In this lesson, you'll learn to create professional documents - the kind you actually need for real work.

## The Document Skills

Claude Cowork has specialized skills for creating professional documents:

- **Word Documents (.docx)** - Reports, memos, proposals
- **Excel Spreadsheets (.xlsx)** - Data analysis, budgets, tracking
- **PowerPoint Presentations (.pptx)** - Slide decks for meetings

These aren't just text dumps - they're properly formatted, professional documents you can share with colleagues.

STOP: Let's create each type. Ready?

USER: Yes

---

## Creating a Word Document

Let's create a proposal document for leadership about the solution idea you've been developing.

STOP: Ask me to create a Word document proposing the solution you identified in previous lessons. Include the key findings from your research.

USER: Types request for Word document

<!-- CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a proposal document tailored to the student's scenario. Use the core discovery (the problem identified through research) and the solution seed (the idea developed in Lesson 1.5) to populate the document.

The proposal should include:
- Executive summary
- Problem statement (drawn from the research findings in previous lessons)
- Proposed solution (the solution idea from Lesson 1.5)
- Expected outcomes
- Next steps

Pull specific details from the student's scenario context files and any organized notes from earlier lessons. The tone should be professional and ready to present to decision-makers within the scenario's organization.
-->

ACTION: Use the docx skill to create a professional proposal document:
- Title: A clear proposal title referencing the solution and the organization
- Executive summary
- Problem statement (from research findings)
- Proposed solution (the solution concept from Lesson 1.5)
- Expected outcomes
- Next steps

Save as organized/proposal.docx

Done! I've created a Word document with the proposal. You can download it and open it in Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

STOP: See how that's a real, downloadable Word document? Not just text - an actual .docx file with proper formatting. Ready to try a spreadsheet?

USER: Yes

---

## Creating an Excel Spreadsheet

Decision-makers will want to see the numbers. Let's create a spreadsheet that shows where things stand now and where they could be with your proposed solution.

STOP: Ask me to create an Excel spreadsheet comparing current metrics to projected metrics if we implement the solution.

USER: Types request for Excel spreadsheet

<!-- CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a spreadsheet using data from the student's scenario. Pull current metrics from the scenario's data/context files (e.g., sales figures, budget numbers, engagement rates, attendance data, response rates - whatever is relevant to this scenario).

Then project improvements based on the proposed solution from Lesson 1.5. The spreadsheet should include:
- Current state metrics (real numbers from the scenario files)
- Projected metrics with the solution implemented
- Percentage improvements / changes
- Simple charts showing the before/after comparison
- Working formulas so the student can see how calculations are derived

The specific metrics will vary by scenario - use whatever quantitative data is available in the scenario's inherited files.
-->

ACTION: Use the xlsx skill to create a spreadsheet with:
- Current metrics (from the scenario's data and context files)
- Projected metrics with the proposed solution
- Percentage improvements
- Simple charts showing the comparison

Save as organized/metrics-projection.xlsx

Done! I've created an Excel spreadsheet with the data and projections. It includes formulas and can be edited in Excel or Google Sheets.

STOP: Real spreadsheet with real formulas. You could hand this to your CFO. Ready for a presentation?

USER: Yes

---

## Creating a PowerPoint Presentation

For the big meeting, you'll need slides. Let's create a presentation that tells the story of your discovery and solution.

STOP: Ask me to create a PowerPoint presentation about the problem you uncovered and the solution you're proposing.

USER: Types request for PowerPoint

<!-- CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a presentation that tells the narrative arc of the student's work across this module:

1. Title slide (solution name + organization name)
2. The Problem - what research revealed (2-3 slides)
3. Key Research Findings - the most compelling data points and insights
4. The Proposed Solution - what it is and how it works
5. How It Works - implementation details
6. Expected Outcomes - projected improvements
7. Next Steps - what needs to happen to move forward

Draw all content from the student's scenario context and their work in previous lessons. The presentation should tell a compelling story: here's what we found, here's what it means, here's what we should do about it.
-->

ACTION: Use the pptx skill to create a presentation with:
- Title slide
- The Problem (what research uncovered)
- Key Research Findings (3-4 slides)
- The Proposed Solution
- How It Works
- Expected Outcomes
- Next Steps

Save as organized/presentation.pptx

Done! I've created a PowerPoint presentation you can present to leadership.

STOP: That's a complete slide deck. You could walk into a meeting with this. All three document types - Word, Excel, PowerPoint - created from conversation. Ready to learn when to use each?

USER: Yes

---

## When to Use Each Format

**Word Documents (.docx):**
- Written proposals and reports
- Memos and formal communications
- Documentation that needs to be read thoroughly
- Anything requiring detailed explanation

**Excel Spreadsheets (.xlsx):**
- Data and numbers
- Budgets and financial projections
- Tracking and lists
- Anything that needs calculations or sorting

**PowerPoint Presentations (.pptx):**
- Meeting presentations
- Visual storytelling
- High-level overviews
- Anything you'll present to a group

STOP: Match the format to the purpose. You can also ask me to convert between formats or create multiple documents from the same content. Make sense?

USER: Yes

---

## Getting Perspectives (Sub-agents)

Before we finalize anything, let's get some feedback. I can create specialized "reviewers" that look at your work from different perspectives.

Think of them as virtual advisors:
- An **executive** perspective - "Does this make business sense?"
- A **creative/design** perspective - "Is this clear and engaging?"
- A **frontline** perspective - "Is this realistic on the ground?"

STOP: Ask me to have three different perspectives review our proposal.

USER: Types request for multi-perspective review

<!-- CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS:
Run three sub-agent reviews of the proposal document (organized/proposal.docx or its content). Each sub-agent should adopt a distinct perspective and provide substantive, scenario-specific feedback.

**Perspective 1 - Executive/Leadership:**
Review from a senior decision-maker's viewpoint. Focus on: Does this make business sense? What's the ROI? Are the projections realistic? What risks are being overlooked? What would make this a stronger business case?

**Perspective 2 - Creative/Design:**
Review from a creative or design-thinking perspective. Focus on: Is this concept engaging? Does it connect emotionally with the target audience? Is the experience well-designed? What would make it more compelling, more human, more memorable?

**Perspective 3 - Frontline/Implementation:**
Review from the perspective of the person who would actually implement or be most affected by this solution day-to-day. The specific role depends on the scenario:

- bookstore-turnaround: bookstore staff member
- event-planning: volunteer coordinator
- freelancer-consultant: client
- hr-people-ops: employee
- loyalty-program: server or cashier
- nonprofit-grant: program coordinator
- product-launch: end user
- real-estate: buyer or seller
- restaurant-rebrand: kitchen or front-of-house staff

Each perspective should provide 2-4 sentences of feedback that feel authentic to that role. The frontline perspective is especially valuable because it grounds the proposal in operational reality.

Synthesize all three perspectives into a single feedback document.
-->

ACTION: Run three sub-agent reviews:
1. Executive/leadership perspective on the proposal
2. Creative/design perspective on the concept
3. Frontline/implementation perspective on practicality

Synthesize feedback into reviews/proposal-feedback.md

**The Three Perspectives:**

**Executive:** Reviews the business case - ROI, risk, resource requirements, and whether the projections hold up under scrutiny.

**Creative/Design:** Evaluates the concept's appeal - is it engaging, emotionally resonant, and well-designed for the target audience?

**Frontline:** Provides the ground-level reality check - is this implementable? What practical challenges would arise? What would make it actually work day-to-day?

I've saved the full feedback to reviews/proposal-feedback.md.

STOP: See how each perspective adds something different? The frontline insight is especially valuable - it grounds the whole proposal in operational reality. Ready to wrap up this lesson?

USER: Yes

- Presenting data? Create a spreadsheet with charts, then a presentation summarizing key points
- Want feedback before sharing? Get perspectives from different "audiences"
- Reviewing your resume? Get feedback from a "recruiter," "hiring manager," and "career coach"
- Pressure-testing a business idea? Ask for "skeptical investor," "enthusiastic customer," and "operational realist" perspectives

**Next up:** In 1.7, you'll learn about web research and browser tools - searching the web, fetching content from pages, and even automating browser tasks.

STOP: Ready for 1.7?

USER: Yes / let's go
