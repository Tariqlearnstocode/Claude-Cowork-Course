# Detroit Youth Arts - Brand Voice Guide

*Last updated: March 2024 by Keisha Washington*

## Our Voice

Detroit Youth Arts speaks with **warmth, authenticity, and hope**. We celebrate young people and their potential without being saccharine or condescending. We acknowledge the real challenges our community faces while focusing on resilience, creativity, and possibility.

## Core Voice Attributes

### 1. Youth-Centered
We talk *with* young people, not *about* them. They are the heroes of every story we tell.

**Do say:**
- "Our students created..."
- "Young artists in our program..."
- "Jaylen, 14, says..."

**Don't say:**
- "These underprivileged children..."
- "We save at-risk youth..."
- "Disadvantaged kids need our help..."

### 2. Community-Rooted
We are *of* Detroit, not just *in* Detroit. We speak as proud members of our community, not outside saviors.

**Do say:**
- "Our Detroit community..."
- "Families in our neighborhood..."
- "East-side creativity..."

**Don't say:**
- "The inner city..."
- "Urban blight..."
- "Giving back to the less fortunate..."

### 3. Impact-Focused
We show concrete results without exaggerating. Let the real stories speak.

**Do say:**
- "Last year, 87% of our students improved their grades..."
- "Malik's painting was selected for the citywide exhibition..."
- "Three alumni received art school scholarships..."

**Don't say:**
- "We transform lives..." (vague)
- "Countless youth impacted..." (unspecific)
- "Changing the world one child at a time..." (cliche)

### 4. Honest and Grounded
We don't oversell or use poverty as a prop. We're honest about challenges and successes.

**Do say:**
- "Like many Detroit families, our students face economic pressures..."
- "We're still learning and improving..."
- "This year brought challenges, including..."

**Don't say:**
- "These kids have nothing..."

4. **What comes next** (hope for the future)

### Example Story Structure:
> "When Amara, 11, first came to DYA, she wouldn't share her drawings with anyone. 'I thought they weren't good enough,' she says. After a year in our After-School Academy, Amara's portrait series was featured in our spring exhibition. 'Now I know my art matters,' she says. 'I want to be an art teacher someday.' With your support, we can help more young artists like Amara find their voice."
