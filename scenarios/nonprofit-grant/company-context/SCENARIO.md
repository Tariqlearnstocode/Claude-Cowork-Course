# Scenario: Nonprofit Grant Crisis

## Your Role

You are **Morgan Chen**, the newly appointed Program Director at **Detroit Youth Arts (DYA)**. You started three days ago. Your predecessor, Marcus Williams, resigned abruptly two weeks ago after six years with the organization, citing "personal reasons and philosophical differences with the board."

You've inherited his laptop, his filing system (such as it is), and one very urgent problem.

## The Crisis

The **Michigan Arts Foundation** grant application is due in **14 days**. This is a $50,000 grant that would fund your flagship Summer Arts Intensive program for the next year. DYA has received this grant for the past three years, but renewal is never guaranteed.

The problem: Marcus left everything in chaos. His files are scattered across multiple folders. Some documents contradict others. The impact data doesn't seem to add up. Budget versions conflict. And you're not even sure what the funder is really looking for this year.

The Executive Director, Pamela Okonkwo, is counting on you. "Marcus always handled the Michigan Arts application," she told you on your first day. "He said it was mostly done. I'm sure you can just... polish it up."

It is not mostly done. It is barely started.

## About Detroit Youth Arts

**Founded:** 2009
**Location:** 2847 Gratiot Avenue, Detroit, MI 48207 (in a converted warehouse space donated by a local business owner)
**Annual Budget:** Approximately $380,000
**Staff:** 6 full-time, 12 part-time teaching artists

### Mission Statement
"Detroit Youth Arts ignites creative potential in young people from underserved Detroit neighborhoods through free, high-quality arts education, building confidence, community, and pathways to opportunity."

### History
Detroit Youth Arts was founded by former Detroit Public Schools art teacher Denise Crawford after budget cuts eliminated arts programs in several east-side schools. Starting with weekend painting classes in a church basement with 15 kids, DYA has grown into a year-round program serving hundreds of young people.

In 2016, local business owner Raymond Foster donated the use of his vacant warehouse on Gratiot Avenue, which was renovated into a studio space through volunteer labor and small grants. The organization achieved 501(c)(3) status in 2010 and has grown steadily since.

**Keisha Washington, Development Associate** - Part-time. Manages donor database, helps with grant writing, handles communications. Started six months ago.

**12 Part-Time Teaching Artists** - Local artists and educators who lead classes.

## Your Resources

You have access to Marcus's files - but they're a mess. Some are in the "inherited-chaos" folder. You've been told there might be more on the shared drive, in his email (IT is working on access), and possibly in paper files you haven't sorted through yet.

Key people who might help:
- **Keisha** knows the donor database and has some institutional memory, but she's overwhelmed and only works 20 hours/week
- **DeShawn** knows operations inside and out but doesn't do "the grant stuff"
- **Pamela** is traveling for a family emergency and has limited availability for the next week

## What You Need to Deliver

A complete, compelling grant application that includes:
1. Organizational overview and mission alignment
2. Program description (Summer Arts Intensive)
3. Clear, accurate impact data and outcomes
4. Beneficiary stories/testimonials
5. Detailed, realistic budget
6. Sustainability plan
7. Evidence of community partnerships

## The Stakes

If DYA doesn't get this grant:
- The Summer Arts Intensive may not happen this year
- You might have to lay off two teaching artists
- 150+ kids lose their summer programming
- The organization's credibility with funders takes a hit

No pressure.

## Hidden Complications (You'll Discover These)

As you dig through the files, you'll find:
- Impact numbers that don't match across documents
- Budget figures that seem... optimistic
- Notes that suggest tension between Marcus and the board
- Gaps in the data that need to be addressed
- Clues about what the funder really prioritizes

Your job is to find the truth, reconcile the contradictions, and craft an honest, compelling application. The real story of DYA's impact is good - it just might not be the story Marcus was trying to tell.

Good luck. The kids are counting on you.
