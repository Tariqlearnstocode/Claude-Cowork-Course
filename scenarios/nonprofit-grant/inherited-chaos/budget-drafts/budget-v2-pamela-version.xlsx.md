## PAMELA'S NOTES (handwritten, transcribed)

Marcus -

A few issues:
1. Numbers still don't add up. Request is $45k but expenses show $41k from MAF. Where's the other $4k going?
2. Why did teaching artist pay change between versions?
3. Last year actual costs were $48,200 - this budget is $59k. What changed?
4. Gleaners is NOT confirmed for next summer. Don't say confirmed.
5. "Individual donors - anticipated" is not a real match. Take this out.
6. We said we'd do $50k request. Why $45k now?

Let's discuss.

## MARCUS'S RESPONSE (sticky note)

Pamela -
$45k is safer. They might not give us full amount. Left buffer.
Teaching artists asked for raises. Compromised.
Gleaners always renews. Will be fine.
Will fix the math errors.
