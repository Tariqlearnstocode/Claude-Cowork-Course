## BUDGET NARRATIVE

The Summer Arts Intensive is Detroit Youth Arts' flagship program, serving 60 young people from underserved Detroit neighborhoods with six weeks of intensive, free arts education.

**Personnel (57% of budget):** Teaching artists are our greatest investment. We employ local artists at competitive wages, providing both quality instruction for students and income for Detroit's creative community. The Program Director oversees curriculum, manages staff, and ensures program quality.

**Program Expenses (33% of budget):** Supplies, transportation, and meals ensure that cost is never a barrier to participation. Our partnership with Gleaners provides breakfast and lunch at no cost to families. Field trips to the Detroit Institute of Arts and local galleries expand students' horizons and connect them to Detroit's cultural ecosystem.

**Evaluation (10% of budget):** We are committed to continuous improvement. An external evaluator will conduct pre/post assessments to measure growth in artistic skills, confidence, and social-emotional development.

## NOTES FOR WHOEVER IS FINISHING THIS

1. The math doesn't work. I've been through it three times and can't make it balance. We need $47,500 from MAF but the line items add up to $53,500. Either cut $6,000 or reduce the request narrative. DON'T SUBMIT LIKE THIS.

2. Gleaners is NOT confirmed for summer 2026. The relationship is solid and they've always renewed but technically we don't have it in writing yet. Pamela needs to reach out to confirm.

3. The Wayne State service learner thing is brand new - Jerome said he's interested but nothing is signed. Could be great but may need to remove from this budget.

4. Teaching artist rates: I increased them because Angela and Terrance both said they needed raises or they'd leave. This is higher than last year. Board hasn't approved the new rates yet.

5. Transportation: DeShawn says $5,250 is LOW. Last year was $5,800. We might be underfunded here.

6. The "external evaluation" for $3,000 - we've never actually hired an evaluator. I always just do it myself. But MAF likes to see this line item. If we win and don't hire someone, that's $3,000 we can move elsewhere.

## COMPARISON TO ACTUALS

| Category | Budget v3 | Actual FY25 | Difference |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Personnel | $36,344 | $34,200 | +$2,144 |
| Program | $21,350 | $18,500 | +$2,850 |
| Admin/Eval | $6,406 | $3,500 | +$2,906 |
| **Total** | **$64,100** | **$56,200** | **+$7,900** |

We're budgeting 14% higher than last year's actuals. Can we justify this? Inflation + teaching artist raises maybe gets us there, but it's a stretch.

*v3 - "final" but has issues. Submitted to Pamela on 1/10 but she hasn't responded. I'm leaving 1/18. Whoever replaces me will need to fix this before 2/1 deadline.*
