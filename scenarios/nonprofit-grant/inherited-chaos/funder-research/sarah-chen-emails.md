## Email 1: Pre-Application (November 2025)

**From:** Sarah Chen <schen@michiganartsfoundation.org>
**To:** Marcus Williams <marcus@detroityoutharts.org>
**Date:** November 12, 2025
**Subject:** Checking in ahead of 2026 cycle

Hi Marcus,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out ahead of the February 1 deadline to check in on Detroit Youth Arts' plans for the 2026 cycle.

As you may have seen, we've made some updates to our guidelines this year. We're placing increased emphasis on:
- Authentic community engagement (how do families and young people shape your programs?)
- Sustainable organizational models
- Clear evaluation methods

I know you've mentioned challenges with data collection in the past. I want to be transparent: our board is increasingly focused on measurable outcomes. That said, we also value honesty about limitations. If you're working on improving your evaluation systems, we'd love to hear about that journey - both what's working and what you're still figuring out.

One more note: we're piloting site visits for finalists this year. If DYA is a finalist, expect a visit in March. I'd love to see the program in action and meet some of your students and families.

Let me know if you'd like to schedule a call to discuss your application. I'm always happy to talk through ideas before you submit.

Best,
Sarah

## Email 2: Marcus's Reply

**From:** Marcus Williams <marcus@detroityoutharts.org>
**To:** Sarah Chen <schen@michiganartsfoundation.org>
**Date:** November 18, 2025
**Subject:** RE: Checking in ahead of 2026 cycle

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out! Yes, we're definitely planning to apply again. The Summer Arts Intensive continues to be our flagship program and MAF's support has been crucial.

Great to hear about your priorities. A few notes:
- We've strengthened our school partnerships - now working with 5 schools (up from 3)
- Launched a new partnership with Wayne State University for service learning placements
- Our Teen Leadership program continues to show strong outcomes - two alumni are now teaching artists with us!

On the evaluation front, we're working on improvements. Hoping to engage an external evaluator this year to strengthen our outcomes data.

I'd love to schedule a call in early December to discuss further. Does the week of December 9 work for you?

Thanks,
Marcus

**From:** Sarah Chen <schen@michiganartsfoundation.org>
**To:** Marcus Williams <marcus@detroityoutharts.org>
**Date:** November 20, 2025
**Subject:** RE: Checking in ahead of 2026 cycle

Hi Marcus,

Great to hear about the partnerships - that's exactly the kind of community ecosystem building we love to see. The Wayne State connection is exciting; university partnerships can really strengthen evaluation capacity.

For the call - how about Thursday, December 12 at 2pm? I can do phone or Zoom, whatever works for you.

One question in advance: I noticed in your last report that you served "312 youth" last year, but the attendance data attachment seemed to show lower daily numbers. Can you help me understand how that total was calculated? I want to make sure I understand your reach metrics correctly. No wrong answer here - I just want to be clear on methodology.

Looking forward to catching up!

Sarah

## Email 10: Sarah to Pamela

**From:** Sarah Chen <schen@michiganartsfoundation.org>
**To:** Pamela Okonkwo <pamela@detroityoutharts.org>
**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Subject:** Michigan Arts Foundation - checking in

Dear Pamela,

I just received an out-of-office from Marcus indicating he's no longer with the organization. I hope everything is okay.

I wanted to reach out to confirm whether Detroit Youth Arts plans to apply to our Arts Education grant program this cycle. The deadline is February 1.

I've so enjoyed our partnership over the years and would hate to see a lapse if you're still interested in funding. Please let me know how I can help during this transition.

Warm regards,
Sarah Chen

## Email 11: Pamela's Response

**From:** Pamela Okonkwo <pamela@detroityoutharts.org>
**To:** Sarah Chen <schen@michiganartsfoundation.org>
**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Subject:** RE: Michigan Arts Foundation - checking in

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out. Yes, Marcus has moved on to a new opportunity and we wish him well.

We absolutely intend to apply - the Summer Arts Intensive remains central to our mission and MAF's partnership is very important to us.

We've just hired a new Program Director, Morgan Chen (no relation to you!), who starts next week. Morgan comes from strong youth program experience in Chicago and I'm confident they will do an excellent job with the application.

I'm currently traveling for a family matter but will be back in the office next week. Is there anything we should know about this year's process or priorities?

Thank you for your patience during this transition.

Warm regards,
Pamela

**Cc:** info@detroityoutharts.org
**Date:** January 16, 2026
**Subject:** RE: Michigan Arts Foundation - checking in

Dear Pamela,

Thanks for the quick response. I understand transitions happen and I'm glad you're planning to apply.

A few notes for your new Program Director:
- The deadline is February 1 at 5pm (firm - our system locks)
- New this year: finalists will receive site visits in March
- We're emphasizing community engagement, sustainability, and evaluation this year
- Happy to schedule a call with Morgan if helpful - my calendar link is below

One thing to flag: in past conversations with Marcus, I asked some questions about your outcomes data that never got resolved. I'd encourage Morgan to review your metrics carefully and ensure everything is documented and accurate. We value honesty about challenges as much as success stories.

Please don't hesitate to reach out. Welcome to Morgan, and I hope your family matter resolves well.

Best,
Sarah

## MARCUS'S NOTES (handwritten on printed email)

*On the printed copy of Email 3:*

"Crap. She noticed the numbers don't match. Need to fix this before call. Maybe just say Saturday Studios is hard to track? Or that 312 includes siblings? Or just... be honest? UGH."

*On the printed copy of Email 12:*

"Whoever reads this - Sarah is smart. She knows something's off. DON'T LIE. Just present the real numbers and make them work. 178 kids is still impressive. Good luck. -M"
