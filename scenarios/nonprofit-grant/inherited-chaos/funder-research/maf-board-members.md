## Board Members

### Marilyn Kraft, Board Chair
**Title:** Vice President, Ford Fund
**Background:** 20+ years in corporate philanthropy
**Focus areas:** Workforce development, youth employment, economic mobility
**Why she matters:** Jerome Thompson (Wayne State) knows her from a workforce initiative. She's apparently very interested in programs that help young people see paths to careers. "Art as job training" angle resonates with her.
**Connection opportunity:** Jerome offered to make an introduction if we formalize the Wayne State partnership

### Thomas Chen
**Title:** Founder/Managing Partner, Chen Ventures
**Background:** Tech entrepreneur, early-stage investor
**Focus areas:** Sustainability, scalable models, social enterprise

### Dr. Vincent Torres
**Title:** Professor of Educational Studies, University of Michigan
**Background:** Expert in arts education research, published widely
**Focus areas:** Evaluation, outcomes measurement, evidence-based practice
**Why he matters:** He's probably the one driving the increased emphasis on data. Likes rigor. Our weak evaluation is a concern with him on the board.

### Andrea Washington
**Title:** Retired, former Principal at Cass Technical High School
**Background:** 30+ years in Detroit Public Schools
**Focus areas:** Youth development, school partnerships, college access

**Connection:** Dr. Marcus Jefferson (our board member) probably knows her from DPS circles

### Lawrence Kim
**Title:** Partner, Honigman LLP
**Background:** Corporate attorney, pro bono work for nonprofits
**Focus areas:** Nonprofit governance, legal compliance
**Why he matters:** Probably cares about organizational health - board composition, financial management, policies

### Rev. Patricia Holmes
**Title:** Pastor, Greater Detroit Baptist Church
**Background:** Community leader, longtime arts advocate
**Focus areas:** Community voice, church-based programs, equity
**Why she matters:** Authentic community connection. She'd value programs where community members have real input, not just token representation.

**Background:** High school senior, former participant in MAF-funded program
**Focus areas:** Youth voice, peer perspective
**Why she matters:** MAF includes youth voice on their board - we should highlight our Teen Leadership program and how youth shape our programs

## WHO COULD CONNECT US?

1. **Jerome Thompson** → Marilyn Kraft (workforce initiative connection)
2. **Dr. Marcus Jefferson (our board)** → Andrea Washington (both DPS)
3. **Adrienne Keller (our board)** → Lawrence Kim (both Honigman)

Should we ask board members to make these connections? Might help if we're borderline on funding decision.
