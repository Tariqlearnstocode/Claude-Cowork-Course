### NOT FUNDED (as far as I can tell)

- Some organization from the UP that applied for the first time
- A suburban program that probably didn't meet the "underserved" criteria
- Heard through grapevine that one Detroit org was rejected for "data quality concerns" - yikes

## ANALYSIS: What Gets Funded?

Based on my research:

**Strong applications have:**
1. Clear outcome data (not just "kids served" but actual changes)
2. Sustainability plan - diverse funding, not dependent on one grant
3. Community voice - parents on advisory boards, youth in planning
4. Partnerships that multiply impact
5. Employment/career angles (even for young kids)
6. Evidence of organizational stability

**Weak applications have:**
- Vague outcomes ("build confidence")
- Only one or two funding sources
- No parent/community involvement in governance
- Working alone, no partners
- Staff turnover, organizational drama
- Numbers that seem inflated or inconsistent

---

## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US

**Our strengths (lean into these):**
- School partnerships - we have 5, most orgs have fewer
- Gleaners partnership - addresses food insecurity angle
- CCS pipeline - real pathway to art school
- Local artist employment - 12 teaching artists, fair pay
- Longevity - 15+ years of programming
- Raymond Foster facility donation - sustainability!
- Teen Leadership as workforce development (sort of)

**Our weaknesses (address or minimize):**
- Data consistency (we know the issue)
- No formal parent advisory council (should we start one?)
- Evaluation is weak (surveys weren't completed)
- Heavy reliance on a few grants (not super diverse)
- Recent staff turnover (me leaving doesn't help)

## BOARD RESEARCH

MAF Board of Directors (as of 2025):

**Relevant for us:**
- **Marilyn Kraft** - VP at Ford Fund, cares about workforce development. Jerome's contact.
- **Dr. Vincent Torres** - Education professor at U of M, big on evaluation/outcomes.
- **Andrea Washington** - Former principal, DPSCD. Could appreciate our school partnerships.
- **Thomas Chen** - Unrelated to Sarah Chen. Businessman, probably cares about sustainability/ROI.

**Sarah Chen** (Program Officer, our main contact):
- Been at MAF 4 years
- Previously at Kresge (arts/culture team)
- Seems to value authenticity over polish
- Met her at MNA conference last year - she's sharp, asks hard questions
- Her email in November mentioned "community voice" multiple times

## KEY QUOTES FROM MAF

From their website:
> "We believe the best arts education programs are designed WITH communities, not just FOR them."

From Sarah's panel at MNA conference:
> "I'd rather see honest struggle than inflated success. Tell me what's hard and how you're working on it."

From their 2024 annual report:
> "We are particularly excited about programs that create pathways to creative careers for young people who might not otherwise see art as a viable profession."

## TAKEAWAYS

1. **Tell the truth.** Sarah will sniff out inflated numbers. Site visit means they'll SEE our actual operation.

2. **Emphasize partnerships.** We have them - school partnerships, Gleaners, DIA relationship, new Wayne State thing. This is actually a strength.

3. **Workforce angle.** Teen Leadership is a pipeline to employment - 2 alumni are now teaching artists. Play this up.

4. **Community voice.** We don't have a formal parent advisory council. Can we start one before the application? Or at least describe parent input we DO have (volunteers, feedback).

5. **Sustainability.** Free facility through 2030 is huge. Diverse funding... we're okay on this, not great. DTE, Community Foundation, individual donors, plus MAF.

6. **Data improvement.** Instead of hiding our evaluation gaps, acknowledge them and present a PLAN. "We implemented new survey protocols for 2026..." Sarah said she respects honesty about challenges.
