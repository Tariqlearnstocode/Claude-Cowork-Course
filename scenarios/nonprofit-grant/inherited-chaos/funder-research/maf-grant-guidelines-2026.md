## Funding Priorities for 2026

This year, MAF is particularly interested in organizations that demonstrate:

### 1. Sustainable Program Models
We seek organizations with diversified funding streams and a clear plan for long-term sustainability. How will this program continue beyond our grant?

### 2. Authentic Community Engagement
We prioritize organizations where community members have a genuine voice in program design and governance. Tell us how your community shapes your work.

### 3. Measurable Outcomes
We expect grantees to have clear methods for tracking and reporting student outcomes. Rigorous evaluation strengthens the field.

### 4. Collaborative Partnerships
Strong programs don't work in isolation. Show us how you partner with schools, other nonprofits, and community organizations for greater impact.

### 5. Artist Employment
We value organizations that invest in artists as professionals, providing fair compensation and meaningful employment opportunities.
