## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Detroit Youth Arts requests $35,000 over two years in general operating support from the Kresge Foundation to sustain and strengthen our work providing free arts education to underserved young people in Detroit.

For 15 years, DYA has been a beacon of creative opportunity on Detroit's east side. From our beginning as a weekend painting class to our current operation serving over 300 young people annually, we have remained committed to one principle: every child deserves access to high-quality arts education, regardless of their family's income.

With Kresge's support, we will:
- Maintain free programming for all students
- Fairly compensate our teaching artists ($22-25/hour, above sector average)
- Strengthen our evaluation systems to better demonstrate impact
- Deepen school and community partnerships

DYA is well-positioned for this investment. We have a committed board, clean audits, diverse funding, and most importantly, we are *of* Detroit. Our teaching artists grew up here. Our students' parents grew up here. We understand this community because we ARE this community.

## ORGANIZATIONAL BACKGROUND

### Mission
Detroit Youth Arts ignites creative potential in young people from underserved Detroit neighborhoods through free, high-quality arts education, building confidence, community, and pathways to opportunity.

### History
DYA was founded in 2009 by Denise Crawford, a Detroit Public Schools art teacher who watched budget cuts eliminate arts programs across the district. She started weekend classes in a church basement with 15 students and $500 from her own pocket.

- 2024: Serving 300+ young people annually

## CASE FOR SUPPORT

### The Need

Detroit's young people face compounding barriers to arts access:
- School budget cuts have eliminated art classes in many buildings
- Private lessons cost $50-100/hour, out of reach for most families
- Free summer programs are rare; many children have nowhere safe to go
- Creative careers seem unreachable for kids who've never held a real paintbrush

### Our Theory of Change

We believe that when young people have sustained access to high-quality arts education in a supportive community:
- They develop creative confidence that transfers to other areas of life
- They build skills that can lead to creative careers or college pathways
- They form connections with caring adults and peers
- They see themselves and their community reflected in art

### Our Impact

*Note: This section uses different numbers than the MAF application*

**Youth Served:**
- FY24: 275 unique young people served across all programs
- 178 in registered programs (after-school, summer, teen leadership)
- ~97 additional youth through Saturday drop-ins (estimated)

**Outcomes:**
- 85% of regular participants show improved artistic skills (teacher assessment)
- 79% report increased confidence (student survey)
- 72% report improved academic engagement (student survey)
- 88% of parents report child is "more confident" since joining DYA

**Long-term Outcomes:**
- 100% high school graduation rate among Teen Leadership alumni (n=34)
- 3 alumni received art school scholarships (past 3 years)
- 2 alumni now employed as DYA teaching artists

### What Makes Us Effective

1. **We are the community.** Our teaching artists are local. Many grew up in the same neighborhoods as our students.

2. **We invest in artists.** We pay teaching artists $22-25/hour, above the $15-18 average for youth arts programs.

3. **We remove all barriers.** Free programming, free transportation, free meals.

4. **We think long-term.** Many students stay with us for years, progressing from beginner to leader.

5. **We partner strategically.** Schools, DIA, Gleaners, College for Creative Studies - partnerships multiply impact.

## USE OF FUNDS

General operating support will:

1. **Sustain staff** - Ensure we can retain our talented Program Director and teaching artists through competitive compensation

2. **Strengthen evaluation** - Invest in better data systems, potentially engaging external evaluation support

3. **Deepen partnerships** - Staff time to cultivate school, university, and community partnerships

4. **Maintain accessibility** - Continue providing all programming free of charge

This is not project funding - it is an investment in organizational health and sustainability.

## INTERNAL NOTES (Marcus)

The Kresge numbers (275 served, 79% confidence) are lower than what I put in MAF application (312 served, 94% confidence). Kresge is more sophisticated about data - they would ask harder questions. MAF is smaller foundation, less rigorous.

Going forward, need to decide which numbers to use where. This is getting confusing.

Also note: Kresge asked specifically about "youth voice in governance." I mentioned Teen Leadership but we don't actually have youth on the board or a formal parent advisory council. Should probably start one of these.

*Funded at requested amount. Good relationship with Kresge to maintain.*
