## ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW (1 page)

Detroit Youth Arts (DYA) ignites creative potential in young people from underserved Detroit neighborhoods through free, high-quality arts education.

Founded in 2009 by former Detroit Public Schools art teacher Denise Crawford, DYA began as weekend painting classes in a church basement serving 15 children. Today, we operate year-round programming serving over 300 young people annually in our 8,500 square foot studio space on Gratiot Avenue.

**Our Programs:**
- After-School Arts Academy: Year-round programming for grades 3-12
- Summer Arts Intensive: Six-week immersive summer program (this grant)
- Saturday Studios: Drop-in programming for families
- Teen Leadership Program: Mentorship and college preparation

**Our Population:**
We serve young people from Detroit's east side, predominantly from zip codes 48207, 48213, 48214, and 48215. Our students are 78% Black/African American, 12% Hispanic/Latino, and 89% qualify for free/reduced lunch. Many come from single-parent households and face significant barriers to accessing arts education.

**What Makes Us Different:**
- All programming is free, eliminating economic barriers
- Transportation provided from partner schools
- Local teaching artists provide instruction and serve as role models
- Long-term relationships - many students stay for years

DYA has an annual budget of approximately $380,000 and is led by Executive Director Pamela Okonkwo with a team of 6 full-time and 12 part-time staff.

## PROJECT NARRATIVE (3 pages)

### Need Statement

Detroit's young people face a crisis of access. Budget cuts have eliminated arts education from many Detroit public schools. In a 2022 survey, 67% of Detroit parents said their children have no access to arts classes at school. For families struggling economically, private art classes (averaging $50+/session) are out of reach.

Yet research consistently shows that arts education improves academic outcomes, builds social-emotional skills, and opens pathways to creative careers. Our students need and deserve these opportunities.

### Program Description

The Summer Arts Intensive is a six-week, full-day program serving 60 young people entering grades 4-10. Students attend Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, receiving breakfast, lunch, and high-quality instruction in multiple art forms.

**Disciplines offered:**
- Visual Arts (painting, drawing, mixed media)
- Ceramics
- Music Production
- Theater
- Creative Writing

Students work with professional teaching artists in small groups (10:1 ratio), building skills progressively over six weeks. The program culminates in a public exhibition and performance showcasing student work.

**Daily Schedule:**
- 9:00-9:30: Breakfast, community circle
- 9:30-12:00: Morning session (primary discipline)
- 12:00-12:45: Lunch
- 12:45-2:30: Afternoon session (secondary discipline or enrichment)
- 2:30-3:00: Reflection, dismissal

**Key Program Elements:**
- *Professional Teaching Artists:* Our instructors are working artists paid fair wages ($22-25/hr)
- *Field Trips:* Three excursions to Detroit Institute of Arts, Eastern Market, and local galleries
- *Meals:* Partnership with Gleaners provides nutritious breakfast and lunch
- *Transportation:* Bus service from central pickup points for families without vehicles
- *Final Showcase:* Professional-quality exhibition and performance for families and community

### Goals and Objectives

**Goal 1: Increase artistic skills and knowledge**
- Objective: 85% of participants will demonstrate improvement in at least one art form (measured by teaching artist assessment)

**Goal 2: Build confidence and self-expression**
- Objective: 90% of participants will report increased confidence in their creative abilities (pre/post survey)

**Goal 3: Create community and belonging**
- Objective: 85% of participants will report feeling connected to peers and adults at DYA (post survey)

**Goal 4: Maintain engagement through completion**
- Objective: 90% retention rate (students completing at least 80% of program days)

### Timeline

- February-May 2025: Recruitment, registration, curriculum planning
- June 1: Program begins
- Mid-July: Field trips
- August 8-10: Final exhibition and performance
- August 15: Program ends
- September: Final evaluation and reporting

### Alignment with MAF Priorities

**Sustainable Model:** DYA has operated for 15 years with diverse funding from foundation, government, and individual sources. Our facility is provided rent-free through 2030. This is not a one-time project but an ongoing commitment.

**Community Engagement:** Our teaching artists are from the community. Parents volunteer at events. Students help design curriculum through Teen Leadership. We don't serve the community - we are the community.

**Partnerships:** We work closely with 5 Detroit schools, the Detroit Institute of Arts, Gleaners Food Bank, and College for Creative Studies. These partnerships multiply our impact and ensure sustainability.

## OUTCOMES AND EVALUATION (1 page)

### Outcome Measures

| Outcome | Target | Measurement Method |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Artistic skill improvement | 85% | Teaching artist rubric assessment (pre/post) |
| Increased confidence | 90% | Student survey (pre/post) |
| Community connection | 85% | Student survey (post) |
| Program retention | 90% | Attendance records |
| Parent satisfaction | 90% | Parent survey |

### Data Collection Methods

**Pre-Program (Week 1):**
- Student demographic survey
- Student self-assessment (confidence, connection)
- Teaching artist baseline skill assessment

**During Program:**
- Daily attendance tracking
- Weekly teaching artist progress notes
- Ongoing observation

**Post-Program (Final Week):**
- Student survey (same questions as pre, for comparison)
- Teaching artist final assessment
- Parent survey
- Student reflection/portfolio

### Using Data for Improvement

Data is reviewed by program staff within 30 days of program completion. We identify:
- Which students showed most/least growth (for follow-up)
- Which disciplines performed strongest/weakest
- Areas for curriculum improvement
- Parent feedback themes

This informs planning for the following year. For example, in 2024 we added music production based on student demand identified in 2023 surveys.

### Evaluation Challenges

We acknowledge limitations in our evaluation capacity. As a small nonprofit, we lack resources for external evaluation. Student surveys have approximately 70% response rate. We are exploring partnership with Wayne State University to strengthen evaluation methodology in future years.

## SUSTAINABILITY PLAN (1 page)

### Financial Sustainability

The Summer Arts Intensive is not dependent on any single funder. Our FY25 funding mix:

| Source | Amount | % of Budget |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Michigan Arts Foundation (requested) | $50,000 | 33% |
| DTE Energy Foundation | $15,000 | 10% |
| Community Foundation for SE Michigan | $25,000 | 17% |
| Ralph C. Wilson Jr. Foundation | $20,000 | 13% |
| Individual donors | $25,000 | 17% |
| In-kind (Gleaners, facility) | $15,000 | 10% |
| **Total** | **$150,000** | 100% |

If MAF funding were to decrease, we have relationships with other funders who have expressed interest in expanding support.

### Organizational Sustainability

- **Facility:** Rent-free use of our building through 2030, courtesy of board member Raymond Foster
- **Staff:** Low turnover; teaching artists have been with us an average of 4 years
- **Board:** Engaged, diverse board of 7 with expertise in finance, education, and law
- **Systems:** Clean audit, strong financial management, 3 months operating reserve

### Program Sustainability

- **Demand:** We have a waitlist every summer; demand exceeds capacity
- **Pipeline:** Students move from summer to year-round programs; teen alumni return as teaching artists
- **Partnerships:** School and community partnerships refer students continuously
- **Community Support:** Parent volunteers, local businesses, growing individual donor base

### After the Grant

The Summer Arts Intensive will continue with or without MAF funding, though your support allows us to serve more students with higher quality. We would continue to seek diverse funding sources and adjust scale as needed to maintain program quality.

## REVIEWER NOTES (added post-award)

*Found in Marcus's files - appears to be feedback from Sarah Chen*

"Strong application overall. Good school partnerships and community connections. Budget is reasonable. A few concerns:

- Retention goal of 90% seems high given 80% actual last year
- Survey response rate of 70% limits data quality
- Would like to see more detail on how youth voice shapes programming
- Numbers feel slightly inflated (312 served?) but within acceptable range

Recommending $45,000 (reduced from $50,000 request) to reflect slight concerns about data rigor. Organization demonstrates strong community connection and sustainable model."

*This application was successful but we didn't get full amount. Sarah's notes suggest she's skeptical of our numbers. Need to address this in 2026 application.*
