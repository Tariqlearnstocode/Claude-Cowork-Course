## APPLICATION SUMMARY

**Project:** Art as Healing: Trauma-Informed Summer Program
**Amount Requested:** $75,000
**Project Period:** May 1, 2023 - October 31, 2023

## PROJECT NARRATIVE

### The Need

Young people in Detroit experience trauma at disproportionate rates. Gun violence, poverty, family instability, and community disinvestment take a toll on children's mental health and development. According to the Detroit Health Department, 45% of Detroit youth have experienced at least one Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE).

Art has proven therapeutic benefits. Studies show that creative expression can help young people process trauma, build resilience, and develop coping skills.

### Project Description

"Art as Healing" will transform our Summer Arts Intensive into a trauma-informed program. We will:

1. Train all teaching artists in trauma-informed practices (40-hour certification)
2. Hire a part-time licensed social worker to provide support
3. Integrate social-emotional learning into arts curriculum
4. Offer optional counseling referrals for students showing signs of distress
5. Create a calming "reset room" for students who need breaks
6. Develop a parent support program with community resources

We will serve 100 young people over the summer, with 50 specifically identified through school counselor referrals as having experienced trauma.

### Goals and Outcomes

1. 75 youth will complete the program (75% retention)
2. 80% will report reduced stress/anxiety (pre/post survey)
3. 80% will demonstrate improved emotional regulation (teacher assessment)
4. 100% of teaching artists will complete trauma-informed training
5. 20 families will participate in parent support programming

### Budget Summary

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Social worker (part-time, 4 months) | $18,000 |
| Teaching artist training | $12,000 |
| Additional teaching artists (expanded capacity) | $25,000 |
| Art supplies (expanded program) | $8,000 |
| Reset room setup | $5,000 |
| Parent program costs | $4,000 |
| Evaluation consultant | $3,000 |
| **Total** | **$75,000** |

## REJECTION LETTER

*Received December 2022*

Dear Marcus,

Thank you for submitting your proposal "Art as Healing: Trauma-Informed Summer Program" to the Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan's Youth Development grant program.

After careful review, we regret that we are unable to fund your proposal at this time. This was a highly competitive cycle with 127 applications for limited funds.

While we appreciate DYA's commitment to serving Detroit youth, our reviewers noted several concerns:

1. **Scope expansion:** This project represents a significant departure from your current programming model. Adding trauma-informed practices and licensed clinical staff requires organizational capacity that was not clearly demonstrated.

2. **Budget concerns:** The request of $75,000 represents nearly 20% of your annual budget. This level of expansion in a single project raises sustainability questions.

3. **Outcomes measurement:** The proposed measures for trauma-related outcomes (reduced anxiety, improved emotional regulation) typically require clinical assessment tools. The application did not specify validated instruments or clinical oversight for measurement.

4. **Target population:** Identifying students "as having experienced trauma" through school counselor referrals raises confidentiality and ethical considerations that were not addressed.

5. **Organizational readiness:** Hiring a part-time social worker is not sufficient clinical infrastructure for a program explicitly serving traumatized youth.

We encourage DYA to continue its excellent core work and to consider smaller-scale pilots of trauma-informed practices. You may consider partnering with a mental health organization to provide clinical expertise.

You are welcome to apply again in future cycles. Please contact me if you would like feedback or to discuss other funding opportunities.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Morrison
Program Officer, Youth Development
Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan

## MARCUS'S NOTES (handwritten on rejection letter)

"Ouch. They're not wrong though. This was too ambitious. We're not a mental health org and shouldn't pretend to be.

Lessons:
- Stay in our lane (arts education, not trauma therapy)
- Don't overreach on budget asks
- Don't promise outcomes we can't measure
- Partnerships matter - should have partnered with actual mental health org

Silver lining: our core summer program IS trauma-informed in a basic sense - safe space, caring adults, creative expression. We don't need to medicalize it. Just need to describe it better.

Also the board pushed me to go big here. Will remind them that bigger isn't always better."

## POST-REJECTION CONVERSATION NOTES

*Phone call with Jennifer Morrison, January 2023*

Jennifer was kind but honest. Key points:

1. She likes DYA and our core work. This rejection was about THIS project, not the organization.

2. We should apply again - for core programming support, not a big new initiative.

3. The "trauma-informed" framing worried reviewers. "You're an arts organization doing great arts work. Claiming trauma intervention expertise is a red flag."

4. Numbers in our application inconsistent with what they had on file from previous grants. (!!!) She didn't push hard on this but it was noted.

5. Advice: "Tell the story of what you actually do well. Don't try to be everything. Your niche is valuable."

---

## FOLLOW-UP

Applied to Community Foundation again in 2023 for core program support ($30,000). FUNDED.

Applied in 2024 for $35,000 general operating. FUNDED.

Relationship is good now. Jennifer is supportive. Key lesson: match the ask to what we actually do, don't overreach.
