## Story Draft

When Amara Jackson first walked into Detroit Youth Arts two years ago, she clutched her sketchbook to her chest and refused to show anyone her drawings.

"I thought they weren't good enough," Amara, now 11, remembers. "My cousin said my drawings looked like a little kid made them. I didn't want anyone else to laugh at me."

Amara's mother, Denise, had enrolled her daughter at the suggestion of Amara's teacher at Clippert Academy. "Her teacher said Amara was always doodling but seemed really shy about it," Denise explains. "She thought DYA might help bring her out of her shell."

It took months. Angela Morrison, Amara's teaching artist, didn't push. "Some kids come in ready to create. Others need time to feel safe," Angela says. "With Amara, I just kept inviting her to try things. No pressure. Eventually, she started opening up."

The breakthrough came during the Summer Arts Intensive. Assigned a portrait project, Amara painted her grandmother.

"That painting," Angela says, "was when Amara found her voice. She wasn't copying or hiding anymore. She was telling a story that mattered to her."

Since then, Amara has [LIST ACCOMPLISHMENTS]:
- Had her portrait series featured in DYA's spring exhibition

[QUOTE FROM AMARA ABOUT WHAT SHE'S LEARNED]

"I used to think artists were born special," Amara says. [SOMETHING ABOUT HOW SHE LEARNED EVERYONE CAN BE AN ARTIST]

For Denise, the transformation goes beyond art. "Amara speaks up more now. She's not afraid to share her ideas. Her grades have improved because she's not afraid to be wrong anymore."

## Raw Interview Notes (from Angela)

"Amara is one of those kids where you can literally see the change. First year she would barely talk. Now she helps the younger kids, shows them techniques. She's become a leader.

The grandmother portrait - her grandmother raised her while her mom worked nights. When grandma passed last year, that painting became so important. Amara said it helped her feel like grandma was still with her.

Her technical skills are legitimately impressive for her age. The CCS prep program coordinator saw her work at the exhibition and said she should apply for the middle school portfolio intensive. I think she could get in."

*This is probably our best story. We've watched this kid grow for two years. If we can get mom to sign the permission form, this should be centerpiece of the application.*
