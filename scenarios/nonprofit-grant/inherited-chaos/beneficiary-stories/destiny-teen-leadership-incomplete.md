## Story Start (abandoned draft)

Destiny Washington has been at Detroit Youth Arts longer than anyone except the staff. She started as a nervous 12-year-old. Now, at 17, she's a leader.

"DYA raised me," Destiny says, only half-joking. "I've been here since middle school. This is my second home."

## Interview Notes (raw)

From conversation October 2025:

D: "I don't know who I'd be without DYA, honestly. Like, I know that sounds dramatic, but it's true. My mom worked all the time. Dad wasn't around. I came here after school and the teaching artists basically became my family."

Me: Tell me about your journey here.

D: "I was super shy when I started. I know people don't believe that now because I'm so loud [laughs]. But yeah, I wouldn't talk to anyone. I just wanted to draw in the corner."

"Ms. Patricia [theater instructor] basically dragged me into the first play. I was in the chorus, didn't even have any lines. But being on stage... I don't know. Something clicked. I felt seen for the first time."

Me: What changed for you?

D: "Confidence, I guess? Like, I learned I could do things I didn't think I could do. First it was theater. Then I tried writing. Then they asked me to be a peer mentor. Each time I thought I couldn't do it, and each time I did."

"Junior year, I almost dropped out of school. Things were bad at home. I was failing everything. Ms. Okonkwo [Pamela] found out and she like, intervened. She called my mom, she got me a tutor, she made me come to Teen Leadership even when I didn't want to. She saved me."

Me: What are your plans after graduation?

D: "I'm applying to college. I want to study creative writing and education. Come back and work with kids, maybe here, maybe somewhere else. Give back what I got."

Me: Which colleges?

D: "Wayne State for sure. U of M maybe. I'm scared of the big schools though. What if I'm not smart enough?"

[conversation continued but I didn't get it all down]

## Key Points

- Longest-term participant (5 years)
- Near-dropout intervention
- Theater transformed her
- Now a leader/mentor
- Applying to college (first in family? need to verify)
- Wants to work with youth

---

## Why This Story

- Long-term impact visible
- Crisis intervention (shows DYA as safety net)
- Teen Leadership pipeline
- College aspiration
- Could come back as staff (sustainability!)

---

## What's Missing

Everything. This is basically just raw notes. Would need:
- [ ] Full written narrative
- [ ] Permission from Destiny (she's 17, needs parent?)
- [ ] Permission from her mother
- [ ] Photo and release
- [ ] Academic verification (the "failing everything" to... now what?)
- [ ] College application status update
- [ ] Quotes from staff (Patricia, Pamela)

---

## Concerns

- The crisis intervention story is powerful but sensitive
- Need to handle "dad wasn't around" carefully
- Don't want to define her by hardship
- Should focus on HER agency, not us "saving" her

---

## Current Status of Destiny

As of Jan 2026:
- Still in Teen Leadership
- Should be applying to colleges now
- Keisha might have updated contact for her mom

*I started this in November and never finished. Destiny is one of our best success stories but I never got it written up properly. Whoever takes over should prioritize this one - she's a great spokesperson and graduates in May.*
