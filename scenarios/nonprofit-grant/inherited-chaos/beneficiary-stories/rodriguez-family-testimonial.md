## Story

*Translated from Spanish by Rosa Martinez. Maria prefers to speak in Spanish but gave permission to share in English.*

For Maria Rodriguez, Detroit Youth Arts isn't just an after-school program. It's family.

"When we moved here from Texas, we didn't know anyone," Maria explains. "My husband works long hours. I was home with three kids and no support system. DYA changed everything."

Maria first heard about DYA from a flyer at her daughter Sofia's school. "Free art classes? I didn't believe it. In Texas, everything cost money. I thought there would be a catch."

There wasn't. All three Rodriguez children enrolled - Sofia in painting, Diego in music production, Luna in the introductory arts program. Maria started volunteering on Saturdays.

"I come every Saturday now," Maria says. "I help with snacks, with cleanup. The other parents have become my friends. My kids have become confident."

The impact has been profound. Sofia, the eldest, struggled with the transition to a new school.

[QUOTE FROM SOFIA ABOUT FINDING HER PLACE]

"Sofia was having trouble making friends," Maria remembers. "She's quiet, she was the new kid, and her English wasn't perfect. At DYA, none of that mattered. Art is its own language."

Now 14, Sofia is a mentor in the Teen Leadership Program. She helps younger students - including her own sister Luna - find their creative voices. She's planning to apply to Cass Tech for high school, hoping to study in their art program.

Diego, 12, discovered music production and hasn't looked back.

[NEED QUOTE FROM DIEGO]

"He makes beats in his room now," Maria laughs. "Always the headphones, always the computer. He played one of his songs at the summer showcase. I cried."

Luna, the youngest, is the shyest of the three. But at DYA, she blooms.

"At school, Luna doesn't talk much," Maria says. "At DYA, she tells stories. Big, wild stories. She makes them into little books."

For Maria herself, volunteering has provided community and purpose during a difficult transition.

"I am far from my family. My mother is in Texas. My sisters are in Mexico. Here, the DYA parents - we look out for each other. We share rides. We watch each other's kids. That's what DYA gives you. Not just art classes. Family."

Maria's message to potential funders is simple: "Don't take this away from us. My children need this. I need this. Detroit needs this."

## Raw Notes

Maria Rodriguez interview (conducted in Spanish, December 2025):

"Mis hijos son artistas ahora. Before DYA, Sofia would just sit in her room. Now she teaches little kids how to paint. Can you believe it? My shy girl, teaching.

Diego, he was getting into trouble a little bit. Boys in the neighborhood, you know. Now he has something to do. Something that matters to him. The music keeps him busy.

Luna is still finding herself. But she loves coming here. Every Saturday she asks me, 'Mommy, is it time for art?'

I tell everyone about DYA. At church, at the grocery store. Some people, they don't believe free programs can be good. They think there's something wrong. I tell them, 'No, it's real. Go see.'

If DYA closed, I don't know what we would do. This is our place."

*Strong story for any application emphasizing community impact, family engagement, or accessibility. The immigrant experience adds dimension without making it about hardship.*
