JAYLEN MUSIC STORY - VERY ROUGH DRAFT

*** Marcus's notes - not for sharing yet ***

Jaylen Williams (no relation to me lol), 15
Southeastern High School, 10th grade
Program: Music Production (2 years), Summer Intensive
Teaching artist: Terrance Boyd

Basic story: Kid came in wanting to be a famous rapper, didn't know anything about actual music. Terrance taught him production - beats, mixing, arrangement. Now he's making real music, got played on WDET local hour.

Key moments:
- First beat was "terrible" (his words) - just drums, no melody
- Breakthrough when he sampled his grandmother singing an old church hymn
- That track got him on WDET
- Now teaching other kids in the program

Quotes from Jaylen (need to re-interview, these are from memory):
- "I thought making music was easy. Like, you just talk over a beat. I didn't know there was so much to learn."
- "Mr. T [Terrance] doesn't let you do trash. He makes you do it again until it's actually good."
- Something about his mom crying when she heard the WDET feature?

Quotes from Terrance:
- "Jaylen has natural talent but more importantly he has work ethic. He stays late. He practices at home. That's rare."
- "The grandmother sample track - that's when he went from making sounds to making art."

Outcomes:
- Grades? Need to check. I think they improved but don't have data.
- College? He's only a sophomore. Talking about going to a school with music production program.
- CCS summer intensive - he APPLIED but not sure if accepted. Need to verify.

WHY THIS STORY:
- Black male success story (funders like this)
- Music production = career pathway angle
- WDET = external validation
- Teaching others = leadership
- Concrete accomplishment

PROBLEMS:
- His mom is hard to reach for permission
- Not sure about grades/academic claims
- The CCS thing - I said he got in somewhere but I think I mixed it up with Marcus Jr (different kid)
- Need fresh quotes

Permission status: UNSIGNED - tried calling twice, no answer

---

if I don't get the permission form, might need to use this anonymously. "One student, Jaylen*" with asterisk for name changed. Not ideal.

Also - Terrance might have photos/video of Jaylen performing at the summer showcase. Would need release.

The WDET thing is public record at least. Could verify through station.

---

todo:
- [ ] Call Jaylen's mom again
- [ ] Get fresh quotes from Jaylen
- [ ] Verify CCS application status (DID HE APPLY OR NOT?)
- [ ] Get academic data
- [ ] Find the WDET segment date
- [ ] Photo release

***

This story could be really strong but it's a mess right now. Needs work before it's application-ready.
