## POST-PROGRAM SURVEY (August 2025)

**NOTE: POST-SURVEYS WERE NOT ADMINISTERED**

Due to scheduling issues on the last day of program (exhibition setup), post-surveys were not completed. Marcus indicated he would follow up by email but no responses were collected.

Estimated outcomes based on teacher observations only. NOT validated data.

## TEACHER OBSERVATIONS (Informal)

Compiled from teaching artist verbal reports at end-of-summer meeting

**Painting/Drawing (Instructor: Angela Morrison)**
"Kids showed real growth. Jaylen in particular went from stick figures to actual portraits. I'd say maybe 12 out of 15 in my group really improved noticeably."

**Ceramics (Instructor: David Kwon)**
"Good summer. Lost a few kids in the middle weeks - vacations, summer jobs. The ones who stayed produced beautiful work for the exhibition."

**Music Production (Instructor: Terrance Boyd)**
"Best summer yet. Three kids finished actual tracks. One got played on WDET's local hour!"

**Theater (Instructor: Patricia Odom)**
"Challenging group but we pulled off the showcase. Attendance was spotty - hard in summer."

**Creative Writing (Instructor: Maya Fontaine)**
"Small but dedicated group. Published the anthology as planned. Parents loved it."
