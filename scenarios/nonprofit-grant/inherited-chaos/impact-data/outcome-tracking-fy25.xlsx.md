## DATA GAPS & ISSUES

1. **Saturday Studios:** No reliable data. Head counts only. Cannot report outcomes.

2. **Survey non-response:** 33% didn't complete surveys. Likely biased toward engaged students.

3. **Academic data:** Only 26% provided school records. Cannot generalize.

4. **No comparison group:** Can't attribute changes to DYA vs. other factors.

5. **Attendance tracking:** Paper sign-in sheets. Some data entry errors found.

6. **Double-counting risk:** No unique ID system. Students in multiple programs may be counted multiple times.
