## Dec 15

Board meeting was a disaster. Valerie keeps pushing for "more rigorous evaluation" - easy for her to say from her corner office at the credit union. Does she have any idea how hard it is to get 12-year-olds to fill out surveys?

Pamela backed her up of course. "Funders want data." Fine. I'll give them data.

## Dec 18

Michigan Arts Foundation application coming up. Same drill as last year. They want:
- Impact numbers (make them IMPRESSIVE)
- Budget (keep it under $55k, they don't fund over that)
- Stories (need new ones, can't use Jaylen again)
- Sustainability blah blah
- Something about partnerships this year?? Check the RFP

Sarah Chen from MAF mentioned at the conference that they're really focused on "systems change" and "community-level impact" now. Whatever that means. I think it means they want to see we're not just running programs but actually changing something bigger.

Also she said something about organizations that have "authentic community voice in governance." Maybe mention the parent advisory thing?

## Dec 22

Numbers for the year so far:
- After-school: averaging 28/day (down from 35 last year - DON'T MENTION THIS)
- Summer (last year): 47 kids enrolled, 38 completed
- Saturday: impossible to track, people come and go

For the grant app, I'm using 250 youth served. Close enough when you add siblings and Saturday drop-ins. Can defend if asked.

Had coffee with Jerome Thompson at Wayne State. He works with their service learning program. Said they're looking for more placements for their arts ed students. Could be a good partnership for sustainability section??? Students get credit, we get free help. Win-win.

Also - he knows someone on the MAF board. Marilyn something. Said she's VERY into workforce development angles. Might be worth playing up the "career pathways" stuff even though we barely do that.

Fight with Pamela today. She wants me to "align" my numbers with what Keisha has in the donor database. But Keisha's numbers are UNDER-counting! She only counts kids who complete the full enrollment form. Half our families never finish the paperwork.

I've been counting everyone who walks through the door. My way is more accurate about our TRUE reach. But whatever. I'll figure out which numbers to use where.

---

## Jan 5

Need to finish these before I leave:
- [ ] Grant narrative (started, need stories)
- [ ] Budget (have draft, need to reconcile with DeShawn's actuals)
- [ ] Letters of support (asked DIA, DPSC, Gleaners - no responses yet)
- [ ] Impact data summary (see spreadsheet, use the GOOD version)
- [ ] Logic model (ugh, hate these)

The board doesn't understand that we do GOOD WORK. Kids' lives are changed here. Why do I need a spreadsheet to prove it?

---

## Jan 7

Realized we never did follow-up surveys from summer. Can't report outcomes we don't have data for. Will need to estimate based on teacher observations.

Note to self: next year, ACTUALLY DO THE SURVEYS.

---

## Jan 8

Testimonials to collect:
1. Amara - painting, confidence story (GREAT for this grant)
2. Marcus Jr. (different Marcus lol) - music production, got into CCS summer program
3. The Rodriguez family - all three kids attend, mom volunteers
4. Someone from teen leadership? Maybe Destiny?

Need parent permission forms. Keisha was supposed to handle this in November. Of course she didn't.

---

## Jan 9

Looking at last year's successful application. Used these numbers:
- 312 youth served
- 94% retention
- 89% reported increased confidence

Can I use similar numbers this year? Actual retention is more like 78% but that sounds bad. Maybe "87%" is believable?

REMEMBER: They funded us, so the strategy worked. Don't mess with success.

---

## Jan 10

Partnership update:
- DIA: confirmed, will send letter
- Gleaners: confirmed for summer
- Wayne State: Jerome said yes to letter, service learning partnership
- DPSC: waiting on Dr. Patterson's assistant
- College for Creative Studies: need to follow up
- Eastside Community Network: Angela said yes

Actually we have pretty good partnerships. Should emphasize this more. Last year's app buried it at the end.

## Jan 11

Budget headache. DeShawn says actual costs for summer were $48,200 last year. I had budgeted $42,000 in the grant. We covered the gap with general operating funds but Pamela doesn't know that.

For this year's app, I'm putting $47,500 to be safe. Will need to pad some line items to get there. Food costs going up - that's real. Art supplies - can justify an increase. "Evaluation" - throw in $3,000, we're never going to spend it but they like to see it.

## Jan 12

Sarah Chen from MAF emailed. Subject: "Checking in on your application"

Good sign or bad sign? Either they're interested or they're fishing. Responded saying everything's on track. (It's not.)

She mentioned they're doing site visits for finalists this year. Great, more pressure.

## Jan 14 - IMPORTANT FOR MAF APPLICATION

Went back through MAF's grants from last year. Pattern I'm seeing:

FUNDED:
- Focus on partnerships, not just programs
- Sustainability plans (what happens after grant ends)
- Diverse funding streams
- Community input in design
- Clear metrics WITH ACTUAL DATA COLLECTION METHODS

NOT FUNDED (or reduced):
- "We serve X kids" without depth
- One-time project funding
- No matching funds
- Vague outcomes

We're actually strong on partnerships and sustainability but I've been underselling it. CCS pipeline is real - 3 kids got scholarships. DIA partnership is solid. Wayne State thing is new but promising.

Weakness: our metrics. We SAY 94% retention but our sign-in sheets don't actually support that. If they ask for documentation we're in trouble.

---

## Jan 15

Can't do this anymore.

Pamela wants one thing. Board wants another. Funders want a third thing. I spend more time writing reports than working with kids.

Started looking at other positions. There's an opening at the DIA education department. Regular hours, no fundraising, pension.

## Jan 16

Keisha found discrepancies between what I reported to Community Foundation vs. what's in the "official" impact report. She's asking questions. Told her the CF application used different methodology. Not sure she believed me.

I need to either fix the numbers or leave before someone figures this out.

---

## Jan 18 - LAST ENTRY

Meeting with Pamela Monday. I'm giving notice.

Whoever replaces me: the Michigan Arts application is due Feb 1. The bones are here but the numbers need cleaning up. USE THE REAL DATA from Keisha's spreadsheet, not my grant versions. The actual numbers are still good - we DO serve ~180 real kids, retention IS around 78-80%, and the program IS making a difference.

I just... inflated things over the years because everyone else does and it seemed like the only way to compete. But Sarah Chen isn't stupid. If they do a site visit, the truth comes out anyway.

The partnerships are REAL. The stories are REAL. The community impact is REAL. Just tell that story honestly. I couldn't figure out how to walk back my numbers without admitting I'd been lying, but you can start fresh.

Good luck. Those kids deserve better than this system.

- Marcus

## MISC NOTES (scattered on legal pad)

- MAF deadline: Feb 1, 5pm
- Online submission portal - password is DYA2024MAF!
- Contact: Sarah Chen, Program Officer
- Award range: $25,000 - $50,000
- We requested $50k last year, got $45k
- IMPORTANT: they care about "authentic community voice" - mention parent advisory council (we should actually start one lol)
- Raymond Foster might do a challenge match? Ask Pamela

## FILE LOCATIONS

- Budget drafts: look in budget-drafts folder, v3 is closest to real but v2 is what I sent to Pamela
- Impact data: impact-data folder, USE "attendance-actuals" not "impact-summary" - they don't match and actuals is correct
- Stories: beneficiary-stories folder, Amara and Rodriguez are almost done
- Old apps: previous-applications folder, 2024 was funded, 2022 was NOT (different funder)
