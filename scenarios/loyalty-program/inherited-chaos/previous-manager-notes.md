# Notes (Marcus's Handoff... sort of)

Okay so I'm leaving faster than expected (new opportunity came up, sorry!) so here's everything I can think of. Good luck!

## Urgent Stuff
- Dana wants the Q3 report by end of month - USE THE TEMPLATE she sent (I think it's in my email somewhere)
- The push notification thing is broken again, IT ticket #4521
- Someone needs to call the vendor about the app redesign quote
- Birthday rewards aren't sending automatically - manual workaround for now (ask Jennifer)

## Random Thoughts
- Why don't people care about the tiers?? We spent so much time on the names
- Maybe we need better rewards? But budget is tight
- Applebee's has games and challenges, should we do that?
- The CFO keeps asking about ROI, I never figured out how to calculate it properly

## Campaign Ideas I Never Finished
Check the old-campaigns folder, there's like 10 things in there. Some might be worth salvaging. The double points one worked okay. The social sharing one was a disaster.

## What I Learned (for what it's worth)
- People sign up because the server asks them to
- They download the app once and forget about it
- Points don't motivate anyone until they're close to a reward
- The tier names are dumb (Regular? Hometown Hero? Nobody cares)

## Weird Idea I Never Had Time For
What if we helped people find their food personality? Like a quiz or something. "Are you a comfort food purist or an adventurous eater?" Could be fun. Never had time to figure it out. Probably dumb anyway.

## Data Stuff
- member-data-summary.csv has the basics
- For detailed data, talk to analytics team (ask for Priya)
- The dashboard login is in the shared password doc

## Customer Feedback
There's 4 months of feedback summaries in the customer-feedback folder. TL;DR: people think it's "fine." Not bad, not good. Just... fine. That's probably the problem.

## Competitor Notes
I did some research on Applebee's, Chili's, Cracker Barrel, and a couple local competitors. In the competitor-research folder. Applebee's is obviously crushing it with their program. The local spots do the relationship thing really well. We're somewhere in the middle doing neither.

## Passwords & Logins
- Ask IT for the marketing dashboard access
- Social accounts are in the shared password doc
- Email templates are in Mailchimp (login with marketing@statefaircafe.com)

## People Who Can Help
- Dana (your boss) - generally supportive, under pressure from above
- Jennifer (ops) - knows where everything is
- Priya (analytics) - can pull any data you need
- Marcus Jr. (yes really) - the server at downtown location, gives great customer perspective

## Sorry this is messy
I really did try to organize this but ran out of time. The program isn't in great shape but it's not hopeless. Someone just needs to figure out why people don't care. That's the real question.

If you figure it out, let me know? I'm genuinely curious.

P.S. - The food personality quiz idea keeps nagging at me. Maybe there's something there. Or maybe I just wanted an excuse to make a Buzzfeed-style quiz. Who knows.
