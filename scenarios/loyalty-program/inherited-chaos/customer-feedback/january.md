### In-Store Comments (from server reports)

- Customer asked "what's the point of the tiers?" - server couldn't really explain
- Several customers didn't know they had the app installed
- One regular said "I come here for the food, not the points"
- Customer complained about too many emails

### Social Media Mentions
- 3 Instagram tags (all just photos of food, no mention of rewards)
- 0 Twitter mentions
- 1 Facebook review mentioning "they have a loyalty program but I never use it"

## Summary
Engagement is low. People don't hate the program - they just don't think about it. The word "fine" came up 7 times in feedback. That's probably not good.
