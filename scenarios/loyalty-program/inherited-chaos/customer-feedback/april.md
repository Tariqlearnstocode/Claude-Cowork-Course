## Summary
April was rough. The gap between how people feel about State Fair (positive) and how they feel about State Fair Rewards (meh) is getting more obvious. People want something that feels like US, not like a generic points program. The phrase "fine but forgettable" has now appeared in 3 different months of feedback. That's our problem in three words.
