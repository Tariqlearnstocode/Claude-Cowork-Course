# Competitor Research: Detroit Diner Co.

## Overview
**Type:** Local Detroit chain (5 locations)
**Positioning:** Michigan-proud, community-first
**Our Overlap:** Same neighborhoods, similar price point

## Their Loyalty Program
**Name:** Detroit Diner Family
**Approach:** Community-tied rewards

### How It Works
- Bring a friend = bonus points
- Support local events = bonus points
- Rewards include donations to Detroit charities
- "Detroit-made" specials for members only

### What They Do Well
1. **Clear Identity** - Everything ties to Detroit pride
2. **Values Alignment** - Attracts their target customer
3. **Social Good** - Rewards that feel meaningful
4. **Differentiation** - Can't confuse them with anyone else

### Their Weaknesses
- Alienates non-local customers
- Can feel preachy about Detroit
- Limited reward options
- Niche positioning limits growth

## What We Can Learn
- Having a POINT OF VIEW matters
- Rewards can align with values, not just transactions
- Identity attracts identity (their customers WANT to be "Detroit Diner people")
- But being too narrow limits you

## The Big Question
What's OUR point of view? "Community" is nice but vague. Detroit Diner owns "local pride." Applebee's owns "convenient." Cracker Barrel owns "nostalgic."

What do we own?
