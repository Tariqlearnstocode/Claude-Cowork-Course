# Campaign: Visit Streak Bonus

**Status:** Draft, never launched
**Created:** March

## Concept
Bonus points for consecutive-day visit streaks to build habits.

## Details
- Visit 3 days in a row: 25 bonus points
- Visit 5 days in a row: 75 bonus points
- Visit 7 days in a row: 150 bonus points + "Streak Champion" badge

## Why It Never Launched
- Worried about gaming (people buying $5 items just for streak)
- Technical implementation was complex
- Wasn't sure the target audience exists (who eats out 7 days in a row?)
- Felt like we were copying Duolingo without the fun

## Assessment
Streaks work for learning apps because there's inherent value in the activity. Nobody NEEDS to come to a restaurant 7 days in a row. This would just gamify an unnatural behavior.

## Notes
- Duolingo streaks work because learning every day is good
- Dining out 7 days in a row isn't necessarily good (or affordable)
- We're trying to create artificial engagement instead of real value
- What if instead of streaks, we helped people discover new things to try?
- Variety > frequency?

## Parting Thought
All of these campaigns are about getting people to DO MORE TRANSACTIONS. None of them are about making people FEEL SOMETHING. Maybe that's the problem.

What if we stopped asking "how do we get more visits?" and started asking "how do we make people feel like this is THEIR place?"
