# Campaign: Refer a Friend

**Status:** Never launched (got stuck in legal review)
**Created:** January

## Concept
Members refer friends, both get bonus points when friend signs up and makes first purchase.

## Details
- Referrer gets 100 bonus points
- New member gets 50 bonus points after first purchase
- Unique referral codes for tracking
- Limit 10 referrals per member per year

## Why It Stalled
- Legal wanted more disclaimer language
- Couldn't figure out how to track properly in the app
- Dev team was busy with other priorities
- Kind of forgot about it

## Assessment
Referral programs can work but they usually just accelerate existing behavior. People who were going to sign up anyway get credited to referrals. Doesn't address why people should WANT to refer us.

## Notes
- Worth finishing if we can solve the tracking
- But shouldn't be a priority
- Need to give people a REASON to refer, not just a REWARD
- "Hey, sign up and get points" is weak
- "Hey, take this quiz to find your food personality" is stronger?
