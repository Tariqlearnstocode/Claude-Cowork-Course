# Campaign: Survey Completion Bonus

**Status:** Ran twice
**Last Run:** April

## Concept
Bonus points for completing customer satisfaction surveys.

## Details
- 15 bonus points for completing survey
- 3-minute survey about program satisfaction
- Emailed to random sample of members monthly

## Results
- 23% completion rate (okay for surveys)
- Got useful feedback (see customer-feedback folder)
- Most common feedback: "it's fine"
- Cost: minimal

## What Happened
People gave feedback, which was valuable. But the feedback keeps telling us the same thing: the program is forgettable. We're paying people to tell us we're boring.

## Assessment
Surveys are useful for learning but don't drive engagement. And we keep learning the same thing. At some point we need to stop asking "what's wrong?" and start fixing it.

## Notes
- One survey response stuck with me:
  "What if you helped people discover their food personality instead of just tracking points?"
- Another: "I'd engage more if it felt like State Fair, not like generic corporate rewards"
- The answers are in the feedback, we're just not acting on them
