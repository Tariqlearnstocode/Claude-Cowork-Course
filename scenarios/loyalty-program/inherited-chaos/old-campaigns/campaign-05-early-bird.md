# Campaign: Early Bird Bonus

**Status:** Draft, never ran
**Created:** February

## Concept
Bonus points for orders placed before 11am to reward morning/brunch regulars.

## Details
- 1.5x points on all orders before 11am
- Daily promotion
- Target: reward our most loyal time slot

## Why It Never Ran
- Realized we'd be rewarding people who already come every morning
- Just giving away margin on behavior that's already happening
- Couldn't justify the cost

## Assessment
This is backwards thinking. We'd be paying more for customers who are already loyal. Should be trying to create NEW behaviors, not subsidize existing ones.

## Notes
- Morning customers aren't the problem
- The problem is the 83% of members who don't engage at ALL
- This would make our best customers happy but wouldn't grow anything
- Killed this idea
