# Campaign: Enhanced Birthday Rewards

**Status:** Implemented, underperforming
**Current:** Active

## Concept
Make birthdays more special - free dessert + bonus points during birthday month.

## Details
- Free dessert (any from menu) during birthday month
- 50 bonus points
- Personalized email with birthday message

## Results
- 62% redemption rate (decent)
- But 73% of those were people who were already regular visitors
- Didn't bring back lapsed members
- Email open rate on birthday emails: 31% (better than average)

## What Happened
Regular customers like it. But it's not reactivating anyone who stopped coming. The people who care about the birthday reward already cared about State Fair.

## Assessment
Nice to have, but not moving the needle. Birthday rewards are table stakes - everyone has them. Doesn't differentiate us.

## Notes
- Could we make birthdays MORE special somehow?
- Personal note from server? Custom dish creation?
- Problem: this is transactional thinking again
