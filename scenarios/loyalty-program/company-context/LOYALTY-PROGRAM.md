# State Fair Rewards Program

## Current Structure

**How it works:**
- Customers sign up via the mobile app or in-store
- Earn 1 point per $1 spent
- 100 points = Free appetizer or side
- 200 points = Free entree (up to $18 value)
- Birthday reward: Free dessert on your birthday month

**Member tiers (launched month 2):**
- **Regular** (0-199 lifetime points): Basic rewards
- **Hometown Hero** (200-499 lifetime points): +10% bonus points
- **VIP** (500+ lifetime points): +20% bonus points, early access to seasonal menu items

## Current Metrics (as of last month)

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Total sign-ups | 4,200 | 6,000 | 70% |
| Monthly active users | 680 | 2,500 | 27% |
| Avg visits/month (members) | 1.8 | 3.5 | 51% |
| Redemption rate | 18% | 40% | 45% |
| 30-day retention | 31% | 60% | 52% |

## The Problem in Plain English

People are signing up, but they're not engaging:
- Only 17% of members have earned any points in the last 30 days
- Most members forget they're even in the program
- The app gets downloaded, used once, then ignored
- Tier progression feels meaningless (no one cares about "Hometown Hero" status)
- Redemptions are low because people don't accumulate enough points

## What We've Tried (and what happened)

1. **Double points weekends** - Slight uptick during promotion, back to normal after
2. **Push notifications** - Low open rates (8%), some users turned off notifications
3. **Email campaigns** - 12% open rate, 2% click-through (industry average is 15%/3%)
4. **Tier celebration emails** - No measurable impact on behavior

## Key Stakeholders

- **Your Manager (Dana)** - Marketing Director, supportive but under pressure from above
- **Leadership Team** - CFO skeptical of ROI, CEO wants "innovation" but unclear on specifics
- **Location Managers** - Frustrated with current program, want something their servers can actually talk about
- **Customers** - Based on feedback, they find the program "fine but forgettable"

## Budget & Constraints

- No additional budget for the program (use what exists)
- Mobile app can be updated (dev team has bandwidth)
- Can launch new campaigns/promotions
- Can add new features within the existing app framework
- Cannot change the fundamental points structure (legal/accounting reasons)

## Files You Inherited

Located in `inherited-chaos/`:
- `previous-manager-notes.md` - Messy handoff notes
- `customer-feedback/` - 4 months of compiled feedback
- `member-data-summary.csv` - Basic engagement metrics
- `competitor-research/` - Notes on chain restaurants and local competitors
- `old-campaigns/` - Half-finished campaign ideas and drafts

Good luck. You've got 3 months.
