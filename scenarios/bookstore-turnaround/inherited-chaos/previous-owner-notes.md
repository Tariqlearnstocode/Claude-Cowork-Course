# Eleanor's Notes

## Undated - probably late 2023

The problem is that people don't READ anymore. I see them on their phones even inside the store. We used to be a sanctuary from all that. Now someone will ask if we have a book and pull out their phone to show me the Amazon listing before I can even walk them to the shelf.

Marcus says we should "meet people where they are." I don't know what that means. Where they are is scrolling Instagram. I'm not going there.

---

## October 2023

Sales are down again. Third month in a row. I don't understand it—the neighborhood is busier than ever. There's a line out the door at the coffee place every morning. The wine bar is packed Thursday through Sunday. But they walk right past us.

Maybe we need better window displays? Derek has ideas but they're all so... trendy. Book covers arranged by color. "Instagram walls." That's not who we are.

---

## November 2023

Interesting: the Sarah Kenyon signing had 47 people. Best turnout in two years. She's local, writes those Lake Michigan mysteries that I find a bit formulaic but people seem to love. We sold 52 copies at the event, plus another 30 the following week.

I keep saying we should do more literary fiction events but Rosa says we can't get the big authors anymore. They all want to do Politics & Prose in DC or Powell's or the Brooklyn stores. Detroit isn't a "destination."

Maybe we need to accept that we're a regional store now. I hate that thought.

---

## November 2023 (later)

Jade wants to expand children's section. Again. I told her we don't have the space—literary fiction needs the front of store. That's our brand.

But I did look at her numbers. Saturday story time is... actually our most consistent traffic driver? 8-15 kids every week means 8-15 parents browsing. She says they buy, but is she tracking it?

Need to think about this more.

## December 2023

Holiday sales: $78,000 total. Down from $92,000 last year. Down from $118,000 in 2019.

**What sold:**
- Children's books (Christmas gift buyers - up 12% from last year actually)
- Gift items (up 8%)
- Used books (steady)
- Local authors section (up! Sarah Kenyon's backlist flew off shelves)

**What didn't sell:**
- Literary fiction (I pushed the National Book Award finalists. Barely moved.)
- Poetry (I ordered 50 copies of the Pulitzer winner. Sold 7.)
- My staff picks table (disappointing but what can you do)

I don't understand why people won't trust my recommendations anymore. Is the relationship that broken?

## January 2024

Marcus found a collection at an estate sale. First editions—Hemingway, Fitzgerald, early Toni Morrison. Paid $2,800. Could sell for $15,000+ to the right collectors.

This is what we should be doing more of. You can't get this on Amazon. But it takes expertise, relationships, time. Marcus is the only one who can do it and he's only part-time.

The rare books are just sitting there though. Need to figure out how to reach collectors. There must be a way.

---

## February 2024

Barnes & Noble is doing a "local authors" table now. Copying us. Of course they are. But it's working for them because they have the foot traffic.

I went in there to look (don't tell anyone). They have:
- 4 local author titles (we have 30+)
- Terrible handwritten signs
- No staff who actually know the authors

We do this better. We KNOW these authors. We've hosted them, supported them, handsold their books for years. But they're getting the sales.

Maybe we need to promote it better? I don't know. Marketing has never been my strength.

## March 2024

Had coffee with Jim from Literati in Ann Arbor. They're thriving. I asked what's working.

He said: "We stopped trying to be everything. We're really good at a few things and we don't apologize for what we don't carry."

They don't even have a general fiction section anymore. Just:
- Michigan authors and Great Lakes regional
- Children's (they expanded twice)
- Curated nonfiction (history, nature, food)
- Journals and paper goods

He said their sales are up 15% in two years.

But they're in Ann Arbor. Different market. Younger, more educated. More money. Right?

---

## March 2024 (later)

Jade resigned today. Said she's going to work at the library. More hours, benefits, and "a place that values what I bring."

I asked her to stay. She said she's been asking to expand children's for three years and I always say no. She said the Saturday story time parents have been asking about chapter book clubs, summer reading programs, author visits for kids. She's been collecting names. 73 families interested.

I told her we're a LITERARY bookstore. Children's is important but it can't be our identity.

She said: "Eleanor, look at your sales data. Literary fiction is dying here. Children's is the only thing growing. I don't understand why you can't see it."

She's wrong. Literary fiction is who we are. Who we've always been. I can't just abandon that because the market is shifting.

Can I?

## April 2024

Jade agreed to stay through summer if I let her pilot a children's author event. Fine.

In other news: the rare book collector network Marcus found is interested in our inventory. Some guy in Chicago bought the Hemingway for $4,200. We paid $800 for that one. That's real margin.

Marcus wants to build this into a real business. Says we could do $50k+ in rare books if we focus on it. "We have something no one else has—my relationships and expertise. And we're sitting on it."

Maybe he's right.

## May 2024

The children's event—some author named Patricia Knowles, writes picture books about Detroit neighborhoods—had 67 people. SIXTY SEVEN. Mostly kids and parents. They bought 89 books. 89!

I don't even remember our last literary fiction event breaking 40 people.

Jade had this look afterward. Not smug exactly. Just... "I told you so" but kinder.

The energy in the store that day. Parents chatting, kids running around with books. It felt like the old days.

I don't know what to do with this information.

---

## June 2024

Landlord called. When the lease renews, rent is going up to "market rate." He said $6,500 minimum. That's $2,300 more per month. $27,600 more per year.

We can't afford that. We can barely afford what we're paying now.

Options:
1. Move (where? everything's expensive now)
2. Negotiate (with what leverage?)
3. Find $30k more in annual profit somehow
4. Close

I'm tired. 31 years. I've given everything to this place.

---

## July 2024

Doctor says I need to slow down. Heart thing. Probably stress-related. Probably 31 years of stress.

Looking at the numbers again. Really looking.

**What makes money:**
- Children's (margins are good, volume is consistent)
- Events (the RIGHT events - local authors, kids stuff, community)
- Used books (pure margin when Marcus buys well)
- Rare/collectible (feast or famine but feast is very good)

**What loses money:**
- Literary fiction (carrying so much inventory, turning so slowly)
- Poetry (my heart but not sustainable)
- Big author events (costs to host exceed sales - we're paying for prestige)
- Trying to compete with Amazon/B&N on bestsellers

Jim was right. We're trying to be everything and we're good at nothing.

But I can't be the one to change it. 31 years of building one thing, and now I'm supposed to tear it down?

---

## August 2024

Decided to retire. Told the investors. They want to find someone to run it—give it one more chance before selling the building.

Left all my notes. Hopefully they help. Probably they won't—just the ramblings of a stubborn old woman who couldn't change with the times.

**If you're reading this, new manager:**

The store can survive. Maybe even thrive. But not the way I've been running it.

The answers are in the data. I just couldn't make myself see them.

Good luck.
