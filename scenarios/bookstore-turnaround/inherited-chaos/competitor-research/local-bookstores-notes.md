*Compiled from visits, calls, and research 2023-2024*

## Literati Bookstore - Ann Arbor, MI

**Distance from us:** 45 minutes
**Overlap:** Some (Ann Arbor people occasionally visit Detroit and vice versa)

### Overview
- ~3,000 sq ft main floor + upper level event space
- Focus: Michigan/Great Lakes regional, children's, curated nonfiction
- Staff: ~12 (mix of full and part-time)
- THRIVING. Always busy when I visit.

### What They've Done Right

**Radical focus:**
- They basically eliminated general fiction
- No poetry section (!!!)
- Minimal bestsellers
- Doubled down on: regional, children's, curated nonfiction, journals/paper goods

**Jim (owner) told me:** "We stopped trying to be everything. Now we're really good at four things and we don't apologize for what we don't carry."

**Children's dominance:**
- Children's is probably 35% of floor space
- Full early reader and chapter book selection
- Daily story times (not just Saturday)
- Kids' events every weekend
- School partnerships throughout Washtenaw County

**Regional identity:**
- "Michigan's bookstore" positioning
- Every Michigan author they can find
- Great Lakes nature, history, travel
- Partnership with Michigan presses

**Events as core business:**
- Author events 3-4x per week
- Revenue stream, not cost center
- Ticket model for major authors (we've never done this)
- Event space rented for private functions

### Their Financials (per Jim, coffee chat)
- Revenue up 15% over 2 years
- Profitable
- Just hired 2 additional full-time staff
- Opened second location (smaller, children's focused)

### Lessons for Us
- Specialization works
- Children's can be a primary identity, not afterthought
- Regional focus creates loyal customers
- Events can make money if done right

### Why We're Not Them
- Different market (Ann Arbor = university town, wealthy, educated)
- Different space (they have better layout)
- Different starting point (they never had legacy "literary" identity)

**Distance from us:** 20 minutes (Northwest Detroit)
**Overlap:** Direct competition for Detroit customers

### Overview
- ~2,000 sq ft
- Focus: Black authors, children's, community space
- Opened 2019 (new, survived COVID)
- GROWING. Good energy.

### What They've Done Right

### Their Challenges
- Smaller than us
- Less inventory depth
- Newer, still building systems
- Dependent on grant funding for some programs

### Relationship with Us
- We don't really compete directly
- Different neighborhoods, different positioning
- Could be potential partner? (combined events, cross-promotion)

### Lessons for Us

## John K. King Used & Rare Books - Detroit, MI

**Distance from us:** 10 minutes
**Overlap:** Used/rare book customers

### Overview
- MASSIVE. 4-story former factory building
- 1 million+ books (not a typo)
- Focus: Used, rare, antiquarian
- Detroit institution since 1983

### What They Are
- Not really a competitor in traditional sense
- They're a destination, almost a tourist attraction
- Used book WAREHOUSE
- Rare book dealer with serious credentials

### Their Model
- Volume used books (cheap, plentiful)
- Rare book expertise (Marcus knows their buyers)
- No events (not their thing)
- No new books
- Minimal staff interaction (browse yourself)

### Relationship with Us
- We send customers there for used books we can't get
- They occasionally send collectors to Marcus
- Different enough that we don't really compete
- Could partner more formally?

### What We Learn
- There's clearly demand for used/rare in Detroit
- Expertise (like Marcus has) is valuable
- We can't compete on volume but could compete on curation

## Book Suey - Hamtramck, MI

**Distance from us:** 15 minutes
**Overlap:** Limited (different neighborhood, different vibe)

### Overview
- ~1,200 sq ft
- Focus: Eclectic, zines, small press, counter-culture
- Staff of 2-3
- Cult following

### What They Do
- Extremely curated, extremely weird
- Zines and small press dominance
- Poetry (they succeed where we fail - why?)
- Local artist partnerships
- Anti-Amazon, anti-mainstream positioning

### Why They Survive
- Very low overhead (tiny space, tiny staff)
- Loyal niche audience
- Completely differentiated from chains
- No pretense of being a "general" bookstore

### Poetry Question
They sell poetry and we don't. Why?
- Their poetry is small press, zine-adjacent, radical
- Our poetry is "establishment" literary poetry
- Different audience entirely
- Maybe our poetry doesn't sell because it's the wrong poetry?

### Lessons for Us
- Niche CAN work at small scale
- Curation + point of view = differentiation
- Not everything has to be big

**Overlap:** Significant - Detroit literary/art crowd

### Overview

- Adjacent to museums
- More upscale positioning

### What They Do Well
- Perfect location (museum-goers browse after visits)
- Extremely focused (art/design books only, basically)
- Beautiful space, beautiful displays
- High price point, high margin

### What They Don't Do
- General fiction (at all)
- Children's (minimal)
- Events (occasionally, tied to museum openings)
- Used/rare (not their thing)

### Lessons for Us
- Location + focus = success
- You don't need to carry everything
- Specialization allows premium positioning

## Summary: What the Successful Stores Have in Common

1. **Clear focus** - They all know exactly what they are
2. **Said no** - They've explicitly decided what NOT to carry
3. **Children's or other anchor** - Most have one category that drives foot traffic
4. **Community identity** - Tied to their neighborhood/city/region
5. **Events as business** - Not just marketing, actual revenue
6. **Good systems** - Online presence, ordering, modern POS

## What We Have That They Don't

- Marcus (rare book expertise = unique in Detroit)
- 31 years of local author relationships
- Established children's story time (best in city, per reviews)
- Prime Corktown location (growing neighborhood)
- Existing customer email list (4,200 names)
- Physical space with character

## The Uncomfortable Pattern

**Every successful store has made choices we've refused to make.**

They've decided who they are. We keep insisting we can be everything. We can't.
