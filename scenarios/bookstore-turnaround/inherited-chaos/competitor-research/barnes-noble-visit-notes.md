*Visit date: March 8, 2024*

## Store Overview

- Approximately 20,000 sq ft (we have 3,200)
- Located in busy shopping center with parking
- Open 9am-9pm daily (we're 11-7 most days)
- Staff: probably 15-20 on floor during my visit
- Cafe in-store (Starbucks license)

## What They Do Well

**Selection depth:**
- Every bestseller, every popular series, every major release
- I counted 8 full bookcases of children's chapter books alone
- We have maybe 2 bookcases total for the same category
- If a customer wants a specific popular title, they have it

**Convenience:**
- Buy online pickup in store (BOPIS) - prominently advertised
- Same-day delivery option
- Long hours, ample parking
- Gift cards available everywhere

**Children's section:**
- HUGE. Maybe 25% of floor space?
- Story time area with seating
- Toys and games adjacent
- Staff clearly trained on kids' books
- Discovery tables by age group

**Events:**
- Looked at events calendar: 6-8 per month
- Author signings, story times, book clubs
- Not as intimate as ours but consistent

**Vinyl & Toys:**
- Expanded into vinyl records, board games, toys
- Seems to be working? Area was busy

## What They Do Poorly

**Soul:**
- Felt like a warehouse with good lighting
- No personality in the displays
- Staff seemed nice but didn't know books deeply
- No sense of curation or point of view

**Staff recommendations:**
- "Staff picks" were clearly corporate-selected
- Asked for a recommendation for someone who liked a specific literary author
- Staff member looked uncomfortable and just pointed at a bestseller table

**Local authors:**
- They DO have a "local authors" table now (annoying - they copied us)
- But: only 4-5 titles, badly displayed
- Staff knew nothing about them
- No relationship with the authors

**Used/Rare:**
- None. This is a category they can't touch.

**Community:**
- Lots of people browsing but no one talking
- No sense that regulars know each other
- Transactional, not relational

## Pricing Comparison

Checked 10 titles we both carry:

| Title | B&N Price | Our Price | Difference |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Popular bestseller #1 | $23.99 | $28.00 | -14% |
| Popular bestseller #2 | $22.49 | $26.00 | -13% |
| Literary fiction new release | $27.99 | $28.00 | 0% |
| Backlist classic | $15.99 | $15.99 | 0% |
| Popular children's | $12.99 | $14.99 | -13% |
| Picture book | $17.99 | $17.99 | 0% |
| Popular series chapter book | $6.99 | N/A | N/A (we don't stock) |
| Local author mystery | N/A | $16.95 | N/A (they don't stock) |
| Poetry collection | N/A | $18.00 | N/A (they don't stock) |
| Used classic (we have, they don't) | N/A | $8.00 | N/A |

**Conclusion:** They're cheaper on bestsellers but not everything. Their prices on literary fiction and backlist are the same as ours. We win on used and categories they don't carry.

## Their Children's Strategy (!!!)

Spent extra time in the children's section because Jade keeps telling me we need to pay attention.

**What I observed:**
- Constant traffic. Always 5-10 families browsing.
- Parents seemed relaxed - kids could explore safely
- Organized by age group, easy to navigate
- "Start here" displays for new readers
- Series organized so you could see progression
- Staff doing story time with ~25 kids

**What they stock that we don't:**
- Full series (every Wimpy Kid, every Dog Man, every Wings of Fire)
- Early readers (Elephant & Piggie, Pete the Cat, etc.)
- Middle grade (extensive - easily 500+ titles)
- Manga/graphic novels section for kids
- Activity books, journals, book-related toys

**Approximate children's inventory:** 4,000-5,000 titles
**Our children's inventory:** ~1,800 titles

**Parent I overheard:** "This is the only place that has everything in the series. I don't have to hunt around."

*This stung. We could NEVER match their selection depth. But we could be smarter about what we DO stock.*

## Foot Traffic Patterns

Observed for 2 hours on a Saturday afternoon:

- Total customers entering: ~180
- Children's section visitors: ~60 (33%)
- Fiction section visitors: ~45 (25%)
- Cafe-only visitors: ~30 (17%)
- Gift/toy section: ~25 (14%)
- Other sections: ~20 (11%)

**Children's is their biggest draw.** By a lot.

## Strategic Implications for Inkwell

**We CANNOT compete by trying to be a small B&N.**
- They have 6x our space
- 5x our inventory
- 3x our hours
- Better parking
- Lower prices on bestsellers

**Where we COULD compete:**
- Local authors (they barely try)
- Used and rare (they don't do this at all)
- Intimate events (theirs are crowded and corporate)
- Personal relationships (impossible at their scale)
- Curation and discovery (their staff can't match Marcus or even Derek)

**Where we're foolishly competing and losing:**
- Bestsellers (give up)
- Genre fiction depth (give up)
- Children's series completeness (can't win, but could be smarter)

**The uncomfortable truth:**
Their children's section is better because they actually invest in it. We have Jade, who's great, but we won't give her resources. If we're serious about families, we need to choose: either invest properly or stop pretending.

## Rosa's Post-It (found attached to this document)

"I went to B&N with my niece. She found 5 books she wanted in 10 minutes. She didn't want to leave. We've never had that experience at Inkwell. That should tell us something."

## Eleanor's Final Note

Barnes & Noble isn't the enemy. They're just big. The enemy is our inability to decide who we are.

They've decided: they're a mass-market bookstore with good coffee and a big children's section. It's not romantic but it works.

What have we decided? "Literary bookstore" means nothing if we can't pay rent.
