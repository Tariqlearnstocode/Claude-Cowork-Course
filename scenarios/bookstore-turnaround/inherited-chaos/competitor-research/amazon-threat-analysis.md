# Amazon Competition Analysis

*Notes compiled by Eleanor, various dates 2022-2024*

---

## The Obvious Problem

Amazon has:
- Lower prices (10-30% below our cover price on most titles)
- Unlimited selection (millions of titles vs our 18,000)
- Free same-day delivery in Detroit
- Reviews and recommendations at scale
- Seamless ordering experience

We cannot compete on any of these dimensions. Trying to is suicide.

## What Amazon Can't Do

1. **Personal recommendations from humans who know you**
   - Our staff knows regulars by name, knows their taste
   - Algorithm can't replicate "you'll love this because you loved that conversation we had about grief memoirs"
   - Requires cultivating relationships, which requires time and consistency

2. **Discovery through physical browsing**
   - The joy of stumbling onto something unexpected
   - But: does this matter to most buyers anymore? Or just romantics like me?

3. **Local author support**
   - Amazon carries local authors but doesn't feature them
   - No handselling, no relationships, no community
   - We are often the ONLY physical shelf space for local writers

4. **Rare and used books with provenance**
   - Amazon/eBay have rare books but it's a mess
   - No expertise, no curation, questionable authenticity
   - Marcus's relationships can't be replicated online

5. **Events and community**
   - Author signings, readings, book clubs, story time
   - The "third place" experience
   - But: requires people to value this enough to pay premium prices on books

6. **Immediate gratification**
   - Customer walks in, walks out with book
   - Same-day delivery competes with this but isn't quite the same
   - Matters most for gifts and impulse buys

## Where We're Accidentally Competing (And Losing)

**Bestsellers and popular new releases:**
- Customer wants the hot new thriller
- We stock it at $28
- Amazon has it for $17, delivered tomorrow
- We lose this sale 90% of the time
- Why do we keep stocking these?

**Genre fiction (mystery, romance, sci-fi):**
- Deep backlist impossible to maintain
- Customers know exactly what they want (specific title in a series)
- Pure commodity transaction - no advantage to buying local
- We should probably stop trying here

**Children's series books:**
- Dog Man, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Wings of Fire, etc.
- Kids want SPECIFIC books in SPECIFIC series
- We can't stock them all
- Parents will buy where they can get them
- BUT: We could do better here if we tried? The discovery side (picture books, read-alouds) is where we shine

## Strategic Implications

**Stop trying to be a general bookstore.** We will never beat Amazon at being a warehouse.

**Double down on what Amazon can't do:**
- Local authors
- Curated discovery
- Events and community
- Rare/used with expertise

**Accept we'll lose certain customers:**
- Bestseller hunters
- Series completists
- Pure price shoppers
- Online-first buyers

*This is painful. I've always wanted Inkwell to be a complete bookstore where anyone can find anything. That era is over.*

## Amazon Data Points (2023-2024)

- **Same-day delivery:** Available in Detroit metro since 2019. Getting faster.
- **Amazon Books physical stores:** Closed all locations 2022. NOT a threat anymore.
- **Price comparison:** Checked 20 titles from our inventory. Amazon averaged 23% cheaper.
- **Kindle/ebook market:** ~20% of all book sales, stable. Not growing but not shrinking.

---

## Customer Behavior Observations

Watched customers in our store on a Saturday (February 2024):

- 3 people checked Amazon prices on their phones while browsing
- 2 of them bought from us anyway ("I'm here, might as well")
- 1 said out loud "I'll just order this" and left
- Multiple parents asked for titles we didn't have; probably went to Amazon after
- NONE of the rare book or local author browsers checked Amazon

**Conclusion:** Price sensitivity varies by category. Literary fiction and bestsellers = price sensitive. Local authors and rare books = price insensitive.

## My Reluctant Conclusion

*Written June 2024*

I've spent 10 years resisting the obvious conclusion: **we need to specialize.**

The stores that are thriving (Literati in Ann Arbor, Powell's in Portland, Parnassus in Nashville) have all found niches:
- Regional focus
- Children's specialization
- Author relationships
- Rare/antiquarian
- Community events

The stores that are dying are the ones trying to be everything to everyone.

We can't out-Amazon Amazon. We need to be something Amazon can't be.

What is that for us? I've never been able to decide. Maybe someone else can.

## Eleanor's Final Note (August 2024)

The Amazon problem isn't Amazon. It's that we never clearly defined what we ARE.

"Literary bookstore" isn't a business model. It's an aspiration.

"Detroit's home for local authors, children's discovery, and rare books" - THAT'S a business model. I just could never bring myself to let go of the rest.
