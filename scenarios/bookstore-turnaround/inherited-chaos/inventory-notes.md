# Inventory Notes & Recommendations

*Compiled from various sticky notes, margin scribbles, and Eleanor's inventory notebooks*

## Literary Fiction - The Heart of the Store

We MUST maintain a comprehensive literary fiction selection. This is who we are. Yes, turn rate is low, but these are the books that matter. When someone comes looking for the latest Booker winner, we need to have it.

**Current approach:** Order 3-5 copies of major literary releases, 1-2 of smaller press titles. Heavy returns to Ingram when they don't sell.

**Problem:** Returns cost money. We're eating 15-20% on returns between shipping and restocking fees.

**But:** We can't NOT carry these. We're a LITERARY bookstore.

## General Bestsellers

I've gone back and forth on this. For years I refused to stock James Patterson and Danielle Steel. That was a luxury of the pre-Amazon era.

Now we stock mainstream bestsellers because people expect them. But we're NEVER going to beat Amazon on price or B&N on selection. We're spending $3000/month on inventory that sells at 15% margin at best.

**Recommendation:** Keep a token selection for walk-ins but don't try to compete. Accept we'll lose those sales.

## Poetry & Essays

My personal passion. Carry full sections for:
- Contemporary American poets
- Translation/international
- Essay collections
- Small press poetry

**Reality check (painful):** Turn rate is 0.7x. We have $18,000 tied up in poetry inventory that might take 2+ years to sell. I've been ordering what I love, not what sells.

*[Another note: "The Mary Oliver sells. The Wendell Berry sells. The experimental stuff from that Minneapolis press? I've had the same 12 copies for 4 years."]*

**Recommendation for successor:** Keep the poets who sell. Let the rest go. I'm sorry.

## Children's Books

Jade knows this better than I do. I've mostly let her handle ordering.

**What she's been saying (I should have listened):**
- We're under-inventoried in early readers and chapter books
- Picture books are our strength but we need deeper stock
- We have NO middle grade selection to speak of
- Parents ask about YA and we point them to Barnes & Noble

**Turn rate: 3.4x** - That's almost 3x better than literary fiction.

**My resistance:** Children's doesn't fit our brand. We're known for serious literature.

**Reality:** Children's is what's keeping us alive.

*[Jade's note paper-clipped to this page: "Eleanor, we turned away 4 families looking for Wings of Fire series last week alone. That's probably $200 we just handed to B&N. I can't keep doing this."]*

## Local Authors Section

This works. This really works.

**What we stock:**
- Detroit-area authors (fiction, nonfiction, poetry)
- Michigan regional (Great Lakes, UP, etc.)
- Self-published locals IF quality is there (I read everything)
- Wayne State University Press (academic but local)
- Small Detroit presses

**Why it works:**
- We're the only store that carries most of these
- Authors handsell for us (they send their friends)
- Events drive ongoing sales (see Sarah Kenyon effect)
- Community feels ownership
- ZERO competition from Amazon on discovery

**Why I haven't pushed it more:**
- It feels like accepting we're "just" a regional store
- Some of the books are... not great? Uneven quality.
- Requires relationships and curation time

*[Marcus note: "This is our competitive advantage. Why do we keep it in the back corner?"]*

## Used Books

Marcus manages this. I've stayed out of it mostly.

**Current system:**
- Buy from walk-ins (Marcus appraises, we pay 25-30% of resale)
- Estate sales (Marcus has contacts)
- Storage unit auctions (occasional gold mines)
- Consignment for higher-end items

**Margins: 50-60%** (!!!)

**Turn rate: 2.2x**

This is quietly one of our most profitable categories. Marcus is underpaid for what he brings.

**Challenges:**
- Inconsistent inventory (depends what comes in)
- Storage space (basement is overflowing)
- No online presence for used books (leaving money on table?)

---

## Rare & Collectible

Marcus's specialty. When it works, it REALLY works.

**Recent wins:**
- Hemingway first edition: bought $800, sold $4,200
- Signed Toni Morrison: bought $150 (estate sale), sold $1,800
- Detroit photos collection: bought $300, sold $2,100

**Challenges:**
- Feast or famine (months with $0, months with $5000)
- Need to reach collectors outside our foot traffic
- Marcus only part-time, can't dedicate to building this
- No online sales infrastructure

*[Marcus note: "There's a $50k+ business here if someone let me build it. I've got relationships with three collectors in Chicago alone who would buy monthly if we had an online catalog and shipping."]*

---

## Gifts & Sidelines

Added out of desperation in 2008. Keeps growing.

**What we carry:**
- Bookmarks, tote bags (expected)
- Literary-themed cards
- Journals and notebooks
- Candles and tea (why? they sell)
- Local maker products (pottery, etc.)

**Turn rate: 2.5x**
**Margins: 45-50%**

I've resisted expanding this because we're a BOOKSTORE not a gift shop. But the numbers don't lie.

*[Post-it: "Customer said we should carry more journals. 'Barnes & Noble has a whole wall of them.' Do we want to be Barnes & Noble? -E"]*

## The Contradiction I Can't Resolve

**What I want us to be:**
- Literary fiction destination
- Serious readers' bookstore
- Poetry haven
- Intellectual gathering space

**What the data says we should be:**
- Children's & family bookstore
- Local/regional author specialists
- Used & rare book dealers
- Community event space that happens to sell books

These feel like different stores. I don't know how to reconcile them.

Maybe you can figure it out.

## Inventory Investment by Category (approximate)

| Category | Inventory $ | Annual Sales | Turn Rate | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Literary Fiction | $68,000 | $38,000 | 0.56x | PROBLEM |
| General Fiction | $32,000 | $31,000 | 0.97x | Marginal |
| Non-Fiction | $38,000 | $30,000 | 0.79x | Okay |
| Poetry & Essays | $18,000 | $6,000 | 0.33x | PROBLEM |
| Children's | $24,000 | $52,000 | 2.17x | WINNER |
| Local Authors | $12,000 | $28,000 | 2.33x | WINNER |
| Classics | $15,000 | $10,000 | 0.67x | Meh |
| Used Books | $22,000 | $45,000 | 2.05x | WINNER |
| Rare/Collectible | $35,000 | $15,000 | 0.43x | High margin when moves |
| Gifts | $18,000 | $26,000 | 1.44x | Good |

*The "winners" represent 32% of inventory investment but generate 58% of revenue.*

*Literary fiction and poetry represent 30% of inventory investment but generate 17% of revenue.*

The math is obvious. I just couldn't make myself act on it.
