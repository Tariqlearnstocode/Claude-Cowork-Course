# Marketing Idea: Social Media Reboot

*Status: STARTED, then abandoned*
*Priority: "LOW" per Eleanor, "HIGH" per literally everyone else*

## The Problem

Our social media is dead:
- Instagram: 890 followers, no posts in 3 months
- Facebook: 3,100 followers (mostly 50+), posts every few weeks
- Twitter/X: 450 followers, last post 2022

Meanwhile:
- Pages Bookshop Detroit: 12,000 Instagram followers, posts daily
- Literati Ann Arbor: 25,000 Instagram followers, consistent engagement
- Average successful indie bookstore: 5,000-15,000 followers

We're invisible to anyone under 45 who isn't already a regular customer.

## The Opportunity

**Instagram/TikTok for bookstores works.**

BookTok and Bookstagram are HUGE communities:
- #BookTok has 230+ billion views on TikTok
- #Bookstagram has 90+ million posts on Instagram
- Book recommendations from social media drive real sales

Indie bookstores using this well see:
- Increased foot traffic from younger demographics
- Event attendance from new audiences
- Free promotion when authors share our posts
- Community engagement that drives loyalty

## What I Proposed (October 2023)

### Content Strategy
- **3-4 Instagram posts per week**
  - New arrivals (pretty stack photos)
  - Staff picks with personal stories
  - Behind-the-scenes (what happens in a bookstore)
  - Customer recommendations (with permission)
  - Local author spotlights
  - Event promotion

- **Instagram Stories daily**
  - Quick shelf tours
  - "What we're reading"
  - Polls and questions
  - Event day coverage

- **TikTok 2-3x/week** (if we're feeling bold)
  - Book recommendations (60 seconds)
  - "POV: you walk into an independent bookstore"
  - Trending sounds with book themes
  - Story time clips (with parent permission)

### Content Pillars
1. **Cozy bookstore vibes** (the aesthetic people crave)
2. **Detroit/local pride** (our unique angle)
3. **Personal recommendations** (the anti-algorithm)
4. **Behind the scenes** (humanize the store)
5. **Community events** (reasons to visit)

### Who Would Do This
Me (Derek).

I'm 22, I use these platforms daily, I know what works.

I'd need 3-4 hours/week to do it well.
Currently I work 15 hours/week on the floor.
Swap 4 floor hours for social media hours = no added cost.

## What Happened

### Week 1-2 (October 2023)
- Got permission to try this
- Posted 5 times
- Got decent engagement (for us)
- One post about fall reading hit 200 likes (our normal was ~20)

### Week 3
- Eleanor asked me to stop
- "The tone isn't quite right"
- "We need to be more careful about brand voice"
- "Social media is a distraction from what we really do"

### My Post That Killed It

I posted a photo of a staff picks table with the caption:
"Sometimes the algorithm gets it wrong. Come let a human recommend your next read."

Eleanor said it was "too flippant" and "we don't criticize technology, we offer an alternative."

I tried to explain that a little edge is what gets engagement. That worked for the post - it was our best performing in months.

She said no.

### Result
- I went back to floor work only
- Instagram went dark
- We lost whatever momentum we'd built

---

## What We're Missing

### Direct sales opportunities
- Can't tag products (no e-commerce to link to)
- Can't promote events effectively
- No way to drive urgency

### Brand building
- Invisible to younger demographics
- No presence in local "things to do" conversations
- Authors can't tag us effectively

### Community
- Story time parents would share content if we had any
- Local authors would promote us if we were active
- Book clubs would engage if we showed up

### Recruitment
- No way to attract younger customers
- Missing entire demographic transition
- Regulars aging out with no replacement

## Competitive Analysis

| Store | Instagram | Posting | Engagement |
|-------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Inkwell Books | 890 | 0/month | Dead |
| Pages Bookshop | 12,000 | Daily | High |
| Literati | 25,000 | Daily | High |
| Source Booksellers | 4,200 | 3-4/week | Medium |
| Book Suey | 2,800 | 2-3/week | Medium |

**We're last. By a lot.**

---

## What I'd Do Differently (if given another chance)

1. **Clear guidelines upfront** - agree on voice/tone before starting
2. **Content calendar** - plan themes so Eleanor can pre-approve
3. **Start with safe content** - pretty photos, event promotion
4. **Build trust** - show results before pushing boundaries
5. **Separate accounts?** - Maybe a "Staff Picks" account for more personality

## The Cost of Doing Nothing

Every month we're dark on social media:
- We're invisible to potential new customers
- Competitors build audience we're losing
- Events underperform because no one knows about them
- Authors stop thinking of us as a partner
- The store feels more and more "for old people"

This isn't theoretical. I hear it from my friends:
"I had no idea that bookstore was still there."
"Is that place still open?"
"I just order from Amazon, I don't know any bookstores."

We're losing the next generation of customers because we refuse to show up where they are.

## Eleanor's Note

*November 2023:*
"Derek is enthusiastic but young. He doesn't understand that social media is a minefield. One wrong post and our reputation suffers. I'd rather have no presence than a bad one.

Also: the time spent on social media is time not spent helping customers in the store. That's the real work."

---

## My Response (never sent, but I'm including it)

Eleanor,

With respect, having no social media presence IS a bad presence. It says we're out of touch, maybe even closed.

And the 4 hours I'd spend on social media would reach more people than 4 hours on a quiet Tuesday afternoon floor shift where I might help 10 customers.

I understand being careful. I understand brand voice. I'm willing to work within guidelines.

But "do nothing" isn't a strategy. It's just slow decline.

## Rosa's Note (attached)

"I agree with Derek. We're invisible online and it's hurting us. Our email open rates are good (34%) because people who already know us are engaged. But we're not reaching anyone new.

The local authors I work with all ask why we're not on Instagram. They can't promote their events at our store if we don't exist online.

Please reconsider. Or at least let Derek try with supervision."

## Status as of August 2024

- Instagram: Still 890 followers, still dead
- Facebook: Sporadic posting (me and Rosa take turns)
- Twitter/X: Might as well delete it
- TikTok: Never tried

I'm still here but I've stopped asking. Maybe the new manager will care.
