## Executive Summary

Children's books are our highest-performing category by turn rate (3.4x), margin efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Yet we allocate only 10% of floor space to children's while literary fiction gets 18%.

This proposal recommends:
1. Expanding children's floor space by 50%
2. Adding inventory in underserved categories (chapter books, middle grade, popular series)
3. Increasing children's programming
4. Repositioning children's as a primary store identity

**Projected impact:** $40,000-60,000 in additional annual revenue with $8,000 investment.

## The Current State

### What We Have
- ~1,800 children's titles (B&N has 4,000+)
- 10% of floor space (back of store, hard to find)
- 1 story time per week (Saturday morning)
- ~1 children's author event per quarter
- No middle grade section
- No popular series (Dog Man, Wimpy Kid, Wings of Fire)
- No YA section at all

### What's Working
- Story time: 8-15 kids weekly, loyal families
- Picture books: Well-curated, good turn rate
- Early readers: Decent selection
- Jade's personal recommendations: Families trust her

### What's Broken
- Parents can't find what kids want (series, popular titles)
- Kids age out after picture books - nowhere to go
- YA readers go to B&N or Amazon
- Children's buried in back, parents don't discover it
- Only one event limits community building

## The Opportunity

### Customer Demand

From comment cards, reviews, and direct requests (documented):
- 47 requests for popular children's series in past 12 months
- 23 requests for middle grade/chapter books
- 19 requests for YA section
- 12 requests for additional story times
- 73 families expressed interest in expanded programming (see below)

### The 73 Families

I've been collecting names of families who want more:
- Summer reading program interest: 73 families
- Chapter book club interest: 34 families
- Additional story time interest: 28 families
- Author visit interest: 45 families

**These are people ASKING to give us money.** We keep saying no.

### Financial Case

**Current children's revenue:** ~$52,000/year
**Current inventory investment:** ~$24,000
**Current turn rate:** 2.17x (inventory value sells every 5.5 months)

If we expanded inventory to $36,000 (+$12,000):
- Conservative turn rate (1.8x): $64,800 revenue (+$13k)
- Maintain turn rate (2.17x): $78,120 revenue (+$26k)
- Best case (2.5x with better selection): $90,000 revenue (+$38k)

**Plus events:** Additional story time could add $5k-8k annually
**Plus chapter book clubs:** Could add $3k-5k annually

**Total opportunity:** $40,000-60,000 in additional revenue

**Cost:** $12,000 inventory + $4,000 fixtures/signage = $16,000 (but $8k of that is inventory we'll sell)

**Net investment:** ~$8,000
**Payback period:** 3-6 months

## Proposed Changes

### Floor Space
1. Move children's from back corner to front right (currently general fiction overflow)
2. Increase from ~320 sq ft to ~500 sq ft
3. Add kid-height shelving
4. Create reading nook (beanbags, cushions)
5. Better signage visible from entrance

### Inventory
1. Add popular series (full sets, not just book 1)
   - Dog Man
   - Wimpy Kid
   - Wings of Fire
   - Magic Tree House
   - Captain Underpants
   - Graphic novels for kids

2. Expand middle grade
   - Current MG titles: ~100
   - Target MG titles: 400+
   - Focus on diverse characters, adventure, humor

3. Add YA section
   - Currently: 0
   - Target: 200+ titles
   - Focus on popular series + award winners

### Programming
1. Second story time (Tuesday morning for non-Saturday families)
2. Monthly chapter book club (ages 8-12)
3. Quarterly children's author events (we've proven these work)
4. Summer reading program (the 73 families!)
5. School partnerships (field trips, book fairs)

### Marketing
1. "Best Children's Bookstore in Corktown" positioning
2. Partner with Corktown Parents Group (they approached US)
3. Social media featuring kids' books (families love this content)
4. Email segment for parents
5. Teacher/educator discount program

## Why Eleanor Said No (and my responses)

**"We're a literary bookstore."**
Children's books ARE literature. E.B. White, Maurice Sendak, Katherine Applegate - these are serious writers. And besides, being a "literary bookstore" isn't paying rent.

**"We don't have the space."**
We have space. We have 3,200 sq ft with 18% dedicated to literary fiction that turns 0.56x/year. Children's turns 2.17x. The math is obvious.

**"Popular children's series are commercial junk."**
Dog Man got kids reading who weren't reading before. That's not junk. That's a gateway. And gatekeeping children's reading is a great way to ensure kids grow up hating bookstores.

**"This isn't our brand."**
Our brand is failing. Maybe our brand needs to change.

**"We can't be Barnes & Noble."**
I'm not suggesting we become B&N. I'm suggesting we become THE children's bookstore for Corktown. Intimate, curated, community-focused - everything B&N isn't. Just with inventory families actually want.

## My Personal Plea

Eleanor,

I've worked here for 3 years. I've watched parents come in excited and leave disappointed. I've watched kids fall in love with picture books and then have nowhere to grow. I've watched our competitors eat our lunch because they stock what families want.

I love this store. I love the community we've built. I love Saturday mornings with the story time kids.

But I can't keep working somewhere that refuses to serve the customers right in front of us. If children's isn't the future of this store, I don't think this store has a future.

Please. Let me try this.

## Eleanor's Response (handwritten, attached)

*March 2024*

"Jade - I've read this three times. Your numbers are persuasive. Your passion is clear.

But I keep coming back to who we are. We've been a literary bookstore for 31 years. Becoming a children's bookstore feels like admitting defeat.

I know you disagree. I know you might leave over this. I don't want that.

Can we compromise? What if we added some chapter books and popular series but kept the overall focus on literary? What if children's grew to 15% instead of 30%?

I can't do what you're asking. But I don't want to do nothing either.

Let me think about it."

*Jade's response (also handwritten):*

"Eleanor, a compromise that still prioritizes literary fiction over what actually sells isn't a compromise. It's just slower failure.

I'll stay through summer, but I've started looking at other jobs. I hope you'll change your mind.

The store CAN survive. But not the way it's been run. Someone is going to figure that out eventually - I just hope it happens before it's too late.

- Jade"
