# Marketing Idea: Local Author Spotlight Campaign

*Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - worked well when we did it*
*Priority: HIGH*
*Created: September 2023*
*Last updated: November 2023*

---

## The Concept

Monthly spotlight on one local author:
- In-store display (front window, featured table)
- Email newsletter feature
- Social media campaign
- Author event
- Backlist push along with new release

Leverage our unique strength: we KNOW these authors. We've supported them for years. We can tell their stories.

---

## Why This Should Work

1. **Unique to us** - B&N can't do this authentically, Amazon can't do it at all
2. **Authors become evangelists** - They promote to their networks
3. **Builds our identity** - "Detroit's home for local authors"
4. **Repeatable** - Once the template is set, we can run monthly
5. **Customer data shows demand** - Local authors section has 2.8x turn rate

---

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1-2: Author Selection & Prep
- Choose author (mix of established and emerging)
- Get author materials (bio, photos, quotes)
- Order inventory (new release + backlist)
- Create display materials
- Schedule event

### Week 3: Launch
- Install window display
- Feature table near entrance
- Email blast to list (4,200 subscribers)
- Social media posts (3-4 across month)
- In-store signage

### Week 4: Event & Wrap-up
- Author reading/signing
- Post-event social content
- Sales tracking
- Author thank-you

## Test Run: Sarah Kenyon (November 2023)

**What we did:**
- Window display featuring her Lake Michigan Mysteries series
- Email to full list (34% open rate, 8% click)
- One Instagram post, two Facebook posts
- Author event: 47 attendees (!!)

**Results:**
- Event sales: 52 copies
- Week-after sales: 30 copies (ongoing discovery)
- Total month: 89 copies of Kenyon books (normally sell ~5/month)
- Estimated revenue: $1,400+ just from one author

**What worked:**
- Author promoted heavily to her followers
- Event energy was great
- Backlist sold as well as new release
- Multiple customers said "I had no idea you carried so many local authors"

**What didn't work:**
- Window display was amateur (hand-drawn signs)
- Social media content was rushed
- Didn't capture emails of event attendees
- No follow-up plan

## Why We Stopped

*Eleanor's note:* "Sarah's event was exhausting to organize. Rosa handled most of it but she's burning out. I don't know if we can do this monthly."

*Rosa's response (attached):* "It took me 8 hours spread over 3 weeks. That's 2-3 hours a week. The return was $1,400 in one month. What else delivers that ROI?"

*Eleanor:* "But we'd have to do it every month to build momentum. That's a commitment."

*No further notes after this exchange.*

## What We'd Need to Restart

1. **Owner commitment** - Someone has to prioritize this
2. **Better templates** - Display materials we can reuse
3. **Social media presence** - Currently dead; need to fix this first
4. **Staff time allocation** - Who owns this?
5. **Author pipeline** - List of 12+ local authors we could feature

## Local Author Pipeline (potential features)

| Author | Genre | Following | Notes |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Sarah Kenyon | Mystery | 8k Instagram | Already did - repeat? |
| Jennifer Wright | Literary fiction | 8k Instagram | Great event spring 2024 |
| Marcus Williams | Detroit history | 3k | Local historian, loyal customers |
| Terri D. | Children's picture books | 5k | Jade suggested |
| Antonio Reyes | Poetry | 2k | Small but dedicated following |
| Patricia Knowles | Children's | 12k | Event was huge success |
| David Park | Thrillers | 6k | Asked about doing event |
| The Moth Detroit | Anthology | 15k | Could be big draw |
| Wayne State Press | Various | Institutional | Partnership opportunity? |

---

## Verdict

**This works. The data proves it.**

Sarah Kenyon: $1,400+ from $0 marketing spend
Patricia Knowles: 67 attendees, 89 books sold

We just... stopped doing it. Because it was "exhausting."

Maybe the new manager can figure out how to make it sustainable.

## Eleanor's Final Note

*Written August 2024:*

"I'm including this because it represents a path I couldn't make myself take. The local author spotlight worked. The numbers were clear. But it required energy I didn't have and commitment I couldn't sustain.

Someone younger, more energetic, or just more willing to focus could build the whole store's identity around this. We have the relationships. We have the track record. We just need someone who will actually do it consistently."
