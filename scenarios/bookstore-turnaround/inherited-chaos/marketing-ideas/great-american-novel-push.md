## The Concept

## Target Customer

- College educated, 35-65
- Values intellectual engagement
- Buys books as identity expression
- Attends cultural events
- Disposable income

This is our CORE customer. The one who's been with us for decades. We need to double down on serving them.

---

## Expected Results

If we can capture serious readers in the metro area:
- 500 households buying 2+ literary fiction books/month
- Average transaction $30
- Annual literary fiction revenue: $360,000+

This would make us sustainable on literary fiction alone.

## Why I Believe In This

*Eleanor's notes:*

"This is who we ARE. We've always been a literary bookstore. The customers who love us love us for this.

Yes, the numbers show literary fiction declining. But maybe that's because no one is fighting for it. Everyone's chasing children's books and gift items.

What if we became the ONLY truly literary bookstore in the Midwest? The serious readers would find us. They'd drive from Ann Arbor, from Toledo, from Grand Rapids.

Powell's did it in Portland. The Strand did it in New York. Why not us in Detroit?"

## Concerns & Counterarguments

**Concern:** Literary fiction turn rate is our worst (1.2x/year)
**Response:** Because we're not marketing it. If we made it our focus, turn rate would improve.

**Concern:** Customers keep asking for other things (children's, genre, etc.)
**Response:** Those customers can go to Barnes & Noble. We need to serve OUR customers.

**Concern:** Industry trends show literary fiction declining
**Response:** Declining at stores that don't champion it. We would be different.

**Concern:** We'd alienate families and genre readers
**Response:** We can still have children's and some other categories. Just not as the focus.

## Status

*Eleanor's note, March 2024:*

"I keep coming back to this. It feels RIGHT. This is who we should be.

But every time I look at the numbers, something nags at me. Literary fiction is 18% of our inventory but declining as a percentage of revenue. Children's is 10% of inventory but growing.

Marcus says I'm 'chasing the past.' Jade says I'm 'ignoring what works.' Rosa just sighs when I bring it up.

Am I wrong? Is my vision for this store outdated?

I don't know. I can't decide. So the campaign sits here, unlaunched."

---

*Later note, July 2024:*

"Looked at this again. The numbers don't support it. I know that.

But abandoning literary fiction feels like abandoning who I am. Who we've been for 31 years.

Maybe the new manager will feel differently. They won't have my history. My attachment.

I'm leaving this in the folder but NOT recommending it. The data says it won't work. My heart says it's the only thing worth doing.

The heart is probably wrong."

## Rosa's Note (attached)

"Eleanor,

I love you, but this campaign would accelerate our decline, not reverse it. We'd be doubling down on a category that represents 38% of inventory but only 17% of revenue.

The 'serious readers' you want to attract represent maybe 5% of the book-buying public. And they already shop with us OR they buy from Amazon because we don't have what they want in stock anyway.

The families walking past our store every Saturday - THEY are our growth opportunity. And we're too snobby to serve them.

Please reconsider.
- Rosa"

## Marcus's Note (attached)

"This won't work. The 'great American novel' customer checks books out from the library or buys used from me. They're not paying $28 for literary fiction when Amazon has it for $18.

Our REAL opportunity is the stuff Amazon CAN'T sell: local authors, rare books, curated discovery. That's where we win.

This campaign is nostalgia disguised as strategy."
