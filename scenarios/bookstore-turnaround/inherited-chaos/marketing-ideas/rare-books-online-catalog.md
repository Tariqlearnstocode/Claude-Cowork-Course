## The Opportunity

We're sitting on a rare books business that could generate $50,000+ annually. Currently it generates ~$15,000 because:
- No one knows we have rare books
- Collectors can't browse our inventory remotely
- We can't reach buyers outside foot traffic
- I'm only here 25 hours/week

**This is money on the table. Real money. Waiting to be picked up.**

## What We Have

### My Expertise
- 8 years appraising and selling rare books
- Deep knowledge of:
  - African American literature first editions
  - Michigan/Great Lakes regional history
  - Mid-century American fiction
  - Detroit publishing history
- Relationships with collectors in Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Toledo

### Current Inventory
- ~600 rare/collectible titles
- Approximate retail value: $60,000-80,000
- Cost basis: ~$20,000
- Potential margin: 65-75%

### Recent Wins
| Item | Cost | Sale Price | Margin |
|------|------|-----------|--------|
| Hemingway first edition | $800 | $4,200 | 425% |
| Signed Toni Morrison | $150 | $1,800 | 1100% |
| Detroit photos collection | $300 | $2,100 | 600% |
| First edition Gatsby (fair condition) | $1,200 | $3,800 | 217% |
| Malcolm X speeches (signed) | $600 | $2,400 | 300% |

These are not flukes. This is what rare books can do.

## The Problem

**No one knows we have this.**

Our website doesn't mention rare books.
No signage in store about rare books.
Google "rare books Detroit" - we don't appear.
Collectors visiting Detroit have no way to find us.

I meet collectors at estate sales who are shocked we exist. "I had no idea there was a rare book dealer in Corktown!"

We're the best-kept secret in Detroit book collecting. That's a terrible marketing strategy.

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Basic Visibility ($0)
- Add "Rare & Collectible Books" to website
- Update Google Business listing
- In-store signage
- Mention in email newsletter

### Phase 2: Online Catalog ($500-1,000)
- Photograph current inventory
- Create simple catalog (PDF or basic webpage)
- Email to existing collector contacts
- Post highlights on Instagram/Facebook

### Phase 3: Collector Network ($0-500)
- Monthly email to collector list
- "New arrivals" notifications
- First dibs on specific requests
- Consignment partnerships

### Phase 4: E-Commerce ($1,000-2,000)
- Add rare book purchasing to website
- List select items on AbeBooks/Alibris
- Enable shipping
- Payment processing

**Total investment:** $2,000-3,500
**Expected ROI:** 10x+ over 2 years

## Revenue Projections

### Current State
- Rare book revenue: ~$15,000/year
- Sales: Essentially walk-in only
- Collector reach: Detroit metro, occasional visitor

### With Online Catalog (Year 1)
- Projected revenue: $30,000-40,000
- Sales: Detroit + regional collectors
- Collector reach: Midwest (Chicago, Cleveland, Toledo, Ann Arbor)

### With Full E-Commerce (Year 2+)
- Projected revenue: $50,000-75,000
- Sales: National (collectors will buy online if they trust source)
- Collector reach: Nationwide

### Five-Year Potential
If we truly invested in rare books:
- Dedicated space in store
- Full-time buyer (me, potentially)
- Active sourcing at estate sales, auctions
- National collector network

Revenue potential: $100,000+ annually
Margin: 60-70%
Profit contribution: $60,000-70,000

## The Competition (or lack thereof)

### John K. King
- Massive volume, but messy
- Limited online presence
- No real curation
- Different customer (treasure hunters vs. serious collectors)

### Online-Only Dealers
- No physical presence for browsing
- Trust issues (condition claims)
- No relationship

### Our Advantage
- Physical store collectors can visit
- My expertise and relationships
- African American literature focus (underserved niche)
- Detroit history focus (underserved niche)
- Trust built over 8 years

## What I Need

1. **Permission to photograph and catalog inventory** (10-15 hours of my time)
2. **Basic website update** (Derek could do this)
3. **Access to email system for collector communications**
4. **$500-1,000 for AbeBooks listing fees**
5. **Your trust that this will work**

I am not asking for more hours. I am not asking for a raise (yet). I am asking for permission to build something.

## Why This Matters for the Store

**Rare books are one of three things we do better than anyone else:**
1. Children's story time (Jade)
2. Local authors (relationships)
3. Rare/used books (me)

Everything else, we're mediocre at best. We're a mediocre literary fiction store. A mediocre general bookstore. A mediocre competitor to B&N and Amazon.

But rare books? We could be the best in the Midwest. Maybe the best in the country for certain niches (Black literature first editions, Detroit history).

This is a competitive advantage sitting dormant because no one will let me do anything with it.

## Eleanor's Notes

*February 2024:*
"Marcus has been asking about this for months. His numbers look good. But I'm overwhelmed and can't take on another project right now. Maybe after the holidays."

*April 2024:*
"Still haven't done anything with Marcus's proposal. He's getting frustrated. He's right to be. I just don't have the energy."

*July 2024:*
"If I were staying, this would be priority #1. Marcus has built something valuable and we're wasting it. I'm leaving his proposal in the file for whoever takes over. Please listen to him."

---

## Marcus's Final Note

*August 2024:*

To whoever reads this:

I've watched this store struggle for 8 years. I've seen opportunities come and go. I've made suggestions that were ignored.

I'm 54 years old. I don't have unlimited runway to build the rare book business I know I could build. If the new management doesn't want to invest in this, I'll probably leave to start something on my own.

But I'd rather do it here. Inkwell is special. The space, the history, the community. It COULD be the home of something important.

Please don't let another year pass without action.

Marcus
