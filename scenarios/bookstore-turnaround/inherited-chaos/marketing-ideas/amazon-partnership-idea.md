## The Idea

Some indie bookstores have experimented with Amazon partnerships:
- Becoming Amazon "pickup points"
- Listing on Amazon marketplace
- Using Amazon fulfillment for online orders

The theory: "If you can't beat them, join them"

---

## What I Found

### Amazon Counter Program
- Indie stores can become Amazon pickup locations
- Amazon pays small fee per package
- Idea is foot traffic from pickups leads to browse and buy

### Amazon Marketplace
- List our books on Amazon
- Amazon takes 15% + fees
- We handle fulfillment
- Massive exposure

### Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)
- Send inventory to Amazon warehouse
- They handle fulfillment
- Higher fees but less work

---

## Why I Thought This Might Work

- We're invisible online
- Amazon already has the customers
- If we can't get them to our website, meet them where they are
- Other stores have done it

## Why It's Actually a Terrible Idea

After more research and talking to Marcus:

### Amazon Counter
- Brings foot traffic but they're there to pick up Amazon packages
- They explicitly came to NOT shop at a bookstore
- Creates awkward dynamic
- Small revenue ($0.50-1.00 per package)
- Signals defeat to customers

### Amazon Marketplace
- Amazon's 15%+ fees destroy margins
- We'd be competing with Amazon's own listings
- Price wars we can't win
- Confuses brand identity
- "Support local" customers would be disgusted

### FBA
- Even more margin destruction
- Lose all control of customer relationship
- Why would we outsource to the company killing us?

## What Other Stores Have Found

Talked to a bookstore in Ohio that tried Amazon Counter:
> "We got maybe 20 pickup customers a day. Zero of them bought books. It felt humiliating."

Read about a store in California that sold on Amazon:
> "We made sales but at 8% margin after fees. It wasn't worth the shipping time."

Industry consensus:
> "Amazon partnerships are a trap. They get the data and the customer; you get scraps."

## Eleanor's Response

"No. Absolutely not. I'd rather close than partner with Amazon."

For once I completely agree with her.

## Why I'm Keeping This in the File

As a reminder that not every idea is a good idea. The fact that someone else did it doesn't mean it works.

Our competitive advantage is being NOT AMAZON. Partnering with them destroys that.

Delete this file. It was dumb.
