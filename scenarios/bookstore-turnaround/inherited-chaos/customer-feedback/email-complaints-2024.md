## Email #1 - January 15, 2024

**From:** amanda.j.parker@gmail.com
**Subject:** Frustrated longtime customer

To whom it may concern,

I've been shopping at Inkwell for over a decade. My kids grew up coming to story time. I've probably spent thousands of dollars there over the years.

But I'm writing to express my frustration. Last week I came in looking for books for my daughter's 5th grade class (she's a teacher). She needed 25 copies of a popular middle grade novel. Your staff told me you don't stock that book because it's "commercial" and suggested some literary alternatives that, frankly, 10-year-olds won't read.

I ended up ordering from Amazon. 25 copies, free shipping, arrived in two days.

I WANTED to give you my business. But you made it impossible. What happened to the store that used to welcome families?

Disappointed,
Amanda Parker

## Email #2 - February 28, 2024

**From:** robert.chen.collector@outlook.com
**Subject:** Rare books inquiry

Hello,

A friend told me you have someone who knows rare books. I'm a collector focusing on African American literature first editions. I'm in Chicago but travel to Detroit regularly for work.

Is there a way to be notified when you get relevant items? A mailing list? Online catalog?

I've searched your website and found nothing about rare books at all.

Thanks,
Robert Chen

## Email #3 - March 12, 2024

**From:** corktown.parents.group@gmail.com
**Subject:** Partnership opportunity?

Hi Inkwell team!

I coordinate the Corktown Parents Group (about 200 families in the neighborhood). We LOVE your Saturday story time and many of us shop regularly.

We're wondering if you'd be interested in partnering on some events:
- Summer reading program for kids
- Author visits to our playgroup meetups
- Book fair fundraiser for the local elementary school

We think there's a lot we could do together! Many of our families are looking for alternatives to screen time and would love more bookstore programming.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss.

Best,
Maria Gonzalez
Corktown Parents Group

## Email #4 - April 5, 2024

**From:** angry_reader_42@yahoo.com
**Subject:** Worst customer service

Your store is a joke. I drove 30 minutes to buy a book for my book club. You didn't have it. I asked if you could order it. Your employee literally said "we don't really do special orders."

WHAT BOOKSTORE DOESN'T DO SPECIAL ORDERS?

I will never come back. And I'll make sure my book club knows to avoid you too.

## Email #5 - May 20, 2024

**From:** jennifer.wright.author@gmail.com
**Subject:** Thank you for the wonderful event!

Dear Eleanor,

I just wanted to thank you again for hosting my book launch last week. The turnout was incredible - over 60 people! - and your staff made everything so smooth.

Several people told me they discovered the store for the first time through my event and plan to come back. One woman said she had no idea there was such a great bookstore in her neighborhood.

I think there's a real opportunity for you to reach more people. Have you considered doing more events with local authors? We all have our own networks and social media followings. I posted about Inkwell to my 8,000 Instagram followers and got so many comments from people who didn't know you existed.

Anyway, thank you again. Please count me as a supporter and let me know if I can ever help spread the word.

Warmly,
Jennifer Wright

## Email #6 - June 8, 2024

**From:** marcus.j.thompson@gmail.com (staff)
**Subject:** Business idea - please read

Eleanor,

I know you're dealing with a lot right now, but I wanted to put this in writing.

I've been doing rare book appraisals and sales here for 8 years. In that time, I've built relationships with collectors across the Midwest. I know what they want, I know how to find it, and I know how to price it.

Last year, our rare books brought in about $15,000. But we're leaving at least $35,000-50,000 on the table because:
1. No one knows we have rare books (it's not on the website, no signage)
2. Collectors can't browse our inventory online
3. I can't reach buyers outside foot traffic
4. I'm only here 25 hours/week

My proposal:
- Let me build a simple online catalog (I'll do it on my own time)
- Create a collector mailing list
- Partner with estate sale companies more systematically
- Consider consignment deals with serious collectors

I genuinely think this could be a $50k+ revenue stream with 50%+ margins. That's $25k+ in profit from a segment we're basically ignoring.

I love this store. I want it to survive. But we need to get smarter about what we're good at.

Can we talk?

Marcus

## Email #7 - July 22, 2024

**From:** bookclub.becky@gmail.com
**Subject:** Seeking new meeting venue

Hi,

My romance book club has been looking for a local venue to meet. We're 12 women, meet monthly, buy our books together (so 12 copies each month).

I stopped by your store and asked if we could meet there. The staff member said your meeting space is only for "literary fiction" book clubs and that you don't really stock romance.

Is this true? Because it seems like you're turning away paying customers for no reason.

We ended up meeting at the coffee shop. They were happy to have us.

## Email #8 - August 1, 2024

**From:** jade.chen.books@gmail.com (staff)
**Subject:** Exit interview documentation

Eleanor,

Since you didn't want to do a formal exit interview, I wanted to document my feedback in writing.

I've loved working here. The store has so much potential. But I'm leaving because:

1. **You won't invest in children's.** I've brought data, customer requests, and concrete proposals for 3 years. The answer is always "that's not our brand." Children's is 25% of revenue with the smallest footprint. Imagine what it could be.

2. **You dismiss ideas without considering them.** Derek suggested Instagram content - shut down. Rosa proposed new book clubs - shut down. Marcus has a rare books business plan - ignored. I organized the most successful event in two years - and you said it was "too much work to do again."

3. **You're so attached to literary fiction that you can't see it's failing.** It's the biggest section with the worst turn rate. The numbers are right there. But you'd rather lose $50k/year than admit the market has changed.

4. **There's no future here.** No benefits, limited hours, no growth path. I can't build a career at a store that won't adapt.

I hope whoever takes over can see what I see: three strong businesses (kids, local authors, rare books) trapped inside a failing literary fiction store.

Good luck,
Jade
