## Free Response: "What would make you attend a book club at Inkwell?"

Selected responses:

> "A thriller/mystery club! I've been looking for one in the area. Please start one!"

> "Something for working parents. Maybe a Saturday morning club while kids are at story time?"

> "I'd love a club that reads new releases and discusses them. Something buzzy and fun, not super serious."

> "Romance book club PLEASE. There are dozens of us!"

> "A 'book to screen' club would be fun - read the book before the movie/show comes out and discuss both"

> "More genre variety. Literary fiction is fine but not everyone wants to read 'sad people making sad choices' every month"

> "I honestly didn't know you had book clubs. Better marketing?"

> "A daytime club for retirees. The evening clubs are hard for us."

> "Make it more social - wine, snacks, less pressure to have 'smart' things to say"

> "Local authors club! Read only Detroit/Michigan writers"

> "Parent book club - meet during story time while kids are occupied"

## Eleanor's Notes on Survey

*Written in margins of printout:*

"Interesting data but we can't be everything to everyone. Mystery and romance aren't our brand. The people who want that can find it at Barnes & Noble."

"Maybe ONE more club. Contemporary fiction? That's close enough to literary."

"NOT doing a romance club. That's not who we are."

*Later note, different ink:*

"77% say they would join a new club if it was their preferred genre. That's 36 people. At one book purchase per month, that's potentially $500-600/month in additional sales. Plus the people they'd bring..."

*Final note, seemingly even later:*

"Why am I so resistant to this?"

## Rosa's Analysis (attached post-it)

Eleanor -

I ran the numbers. If we added just TWO new book clubs:
- Mystery/Thriller (15 members estimated)
- Contemporary/Book Club Fiction (15 members estimated)

That's 30 people buying one book/month = $450-600/month
Plus refreshments revenue
Plus they browse and buy other books
Plus word of mouth

Annual impact: probably $8,000-12,000 in additional revenue

Cost: my time (which you don't pay for anyway) and some folding chairs

Why won't you let me try this?
