## April 2024

**Card #11**

- [no name]

**Card #12**
"The children's section is too small and kind of hidden in the back. My kids didn't even know it was there. Put it somewhere they can see it!"

## May 2024

**Card #15**

## June 2024

**Card #19**

- Disappointed parent

**Card #20**
"Your store is charming but it feels like it's stuck in 2005. No website ordering, no events calendar online, social media is dead. I want to support you but you make it hard."
- Millennial who cares

**Card #21**
"The used book section is a treasure trove. I come every month just to see what's new. Best prices in the city."
- Regular Dave

**Card #22**
"Why is the literary fiction at the front and the kids stuff hidden in back? As a parent I walk in, see nothing for my family, and leave. Put the kids stuff where I can see it!"
- [no name]

## July 2024

**Card #23**
"Came in looking for summer reading for my 8-year-old. Staff member said 'we're more of a literary bookstore.' What does that even mean? Are kids' books not literature?"

- Frustrated reader

**Card #29**

- Neighbor

## Summary Notes (added by Rosa)

Themes I'm seeing:
- Parents LOVE story time but want more kids' events/inventory
- Rare book people are enthusiastic but don't know we exist
- Literary fiction die-hards are loyal but small in number
- Lots of complaints about no online ordering/pickup
- Multiple requests for more/different book clubs
- Store layout confuses people
- Local authors section has passionate fans

I've been saying this for years: we have three different customer bases who all want different things, and we're only really serving one of them (the literary fiction people, who are also the smallest group).

- Rosa, August 2024
