**TonyM. - Detroit, MI**
*6/15/2024*

This place is a vibe. Came for a local author signing (Sarah Kenyon - if you haven't read her Lake Michigan mysteries, you're missing out) and fell in love with the store. The local authors section is incredible - stuff you literally cannot find anywhere else.

Bought four books. Staff actually knew what they were talking about, which is rare these days. Will definitely be back.

I really wanted to love this place. Indie bookstores are important! But...

- They didn't have ANY of the books on the NYT bestseller list
- No online ordering
- Closed Mondays and limited hours
- Staff seemed put out that I didn't already know what I wanted

I ended up at B&N. At least they have what people actually want to read.

The used book section alone is worth the trip. Curated but not overpriced. I found a beautiful old Penguin Classics set for $40 that would have been $100+ online.

Also, if you're into rare books, ask for Marcus. Guy knows his stuff. I collect mid-century first editions and he hooked me up with three I'd been hunting for years.

This store is two things: a mediocre new bookstore and an excellent used/rare bookstore. I come for the second part.

**ParentingInMI - Royal Oak, MI**
*4/28/2024*

Drove here specifically for the Saturday story time because friends raved about it. Story time was great! Jade is wonderful with kids.

Then tried to actually buy books. They had almost nothing my 7-year-old wanted. No popular series, no graphic novels, no early chapter books. Bought two picture books and left frustrated.

How do you have the best story time in the city but no books for kids to graduate into?

**LitLover313 - Detroit, MI**

Ignore the haters. This is a proper bookstore for people who actually read. Not everything needs to be Amazon or Barnes & Noble.

Eleanor recommended a small press novel to me last year that became my favorite book. You don't get that at a chain.

Is it perfect? No. But if you appreciate curation and real bookselling, this is the place.

**FrustratedFred - Dearborn, MI**
*3/30/2024*

One star because I can't give zero.

Tried to order a book as a gift. No online store. Called - they don't take phone orders. Drove there - they didn't have it and couldn't order it for me. Suggested I "try Amazon."

THE BOOKSTORE TOLD ME TO TRY AMAZON.

Why even exist if you're going to tell customers to buy elsewhere?

### ★★★★☆
**DetroitHistoryBuff - Detroit, MI**
*3/12/2024*

Best selection of Detroit and Michigan history books I've found anywhere. Local authors, small press stuff, out-of-print gems in the used section.

If this is your thing, you need to visit. Just don't expect a full-service general bookstore - that's not what this place is good at.

**YogaMom2024 - Corktown, MI**
*2/28/2024*

We've been coming to story time for two years. Jade has watched my daughter grow up. She started recommending chapter books when she saw my kid was ready, found books about topics my daughter loves, and makes every Saturday special.

This store isn't perfect but people like Jade make it irreplaceable. Please pay her more and give her whatever she wants.

UPDATE 6/2024: Just found out Jade almost quit. Inkwell - whatever she asked for, GIVE IT TO HER.

### ★★☆☆☆
**RealistReader - Grosse Pointe, MI**
*2/15/2024*

I appreciate what independent bookstores are trying to do. I really do. But this place feels stuck in 2003.

The emphasis on "literary fiction" (read: stuff that doesn't sell) while ignoring what customers actually want is the definition of out of touch. There's a reason Amazon won.

Either adapt or become a museum.

### ★★★★☆
**CollectorCarl - Toledo, OH**
*1/20/2024*

4 stars because they have no online presence for their rare book inventory, which is criminal.

The actual rare book selection is excellent. Marcus (I think that's his name) is one of the most knowledgeable rare book dealers I've met outside major cities. I've bought three first editions from him over the past year.

My feedback: Build. An. Online. Catalog. There are collectors all over the Midwest who would buy from you if they knew what you had. You're leaving so much money on the table.

### ★★★★★
**LocalAuthorLove - Detroit, MI**
*1/8/2024*

As a Detroit-based author, I can't say enough good things about Inkwell. They host launches, handsell my books to customers, and treat local writers like family.

There's no other store that does what they do for the local literary community. Whatever their problems are (and I know they have some), please don't let this place close. Detroit needs it.

## Yelp Review Summary Analysis

**5-star reviews (42%):** Local authors, rare/used books, story time, personal recommendations, "real" bookstore experience

**4-star reviews (18%):** Acknowledge strengths but note operational issues (hours, inventory gaps, no online)

**3-star reviews (22%):** Mixed - appreciate concept but frustrated by gaps, especially for families

**2-star reviews (12%):** Usually parents who couldn't find kids books, or people who wanted bestsellers/convenience

**1-star reviews (6%):** Almost always operational failures - couldn't order, couldn't buy, felt dismissed

**Key insight:** The 1-2 star reviews are almost never about the *concept* of the store. They're about operational failures and inventory gaps. These are fixable problems.
