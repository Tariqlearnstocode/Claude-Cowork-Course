**Sarah K.**
"Best children's story time in the city! Jade makes every Saturday magical for my kids. We always end up buying at least one book. The store itself is a bit cramped but the staff is wonderful."

**Michael R.**
"I used to love this place but it's felt neglected lately. Inventory is sparse, staff seems overwhelmed, and they still don't have online ordering in 2024. I want to support local but they make it hard."

**CollectorDave_Toledo**
"Hidden gem for rare book collectors. Marcus has an incredible eye and fair prices. Drove from Toledo and found a beautiful first edition Fitzgerald. They need to advertise this more - stumbled on it completely by accident."

**Jennifer M.**
"Disappointed. Came looking for popular kids series (Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Dog Man) for my nephew's birthday. They had nothing. Staff basically shrugged and said 'we focus on quality literature.' Ended up at Barnes & Noble. My nephew doesn't care about 'quality literature,' he cares about Dog Man."

**Detroit_Reader_42**
"Charming store with a wonderful local authors section. Found three Detroit-based mysteries I never knew existed. Wish they had more staff - waited 15 minutes for help because only one person was working."

**Patricia_K**
"I did an author event here and it was the best-attended signing of my tour! The staff clearly love books and their community. This is what independent bookstores should be."

*[Owner response: "Thank you Patricia! Your event was wonderful. Come back anytime! -Eleanor"]*

**QuietReaderQ**
"Parking is impossible on weekends. Store is cluttered and hard to navigate. Found what I wanted on Amazon for $6 less. Sorry but I can't justify the premium for a frustrating experience."

**Corktown_Mom**
"Story time! Story time! Story time! Worth dealing with parking and everything else. Jade is a treasure. Please expand the kids section so we can buy more!!"

### ★★★☆☆ - 8 months ago
**BookClubBeth**
"Our book club has met here for years but honestly the space is getting tired. The chairs in the back room are falling apart. Asked about hosting different genre clubs (romance, thriller) and was basically told that's not their 'brand.' Might look elsewhere."

**LocalAuthor_JT**
"Inkwell has supported my writing career from the beginning. They handsell my books, host my launches, and treat local authors like family. There's no other store like this in Detroit."

**History_Nerd_D**
"Amazing selection of Detroit history and Michigan regional books. The used section has treasures if you're willing to dig. Just wish they were open more hours."

**BusyParent23**
"Closed on Mondays, doesn't open until 11 other days, closes at 5 on Sundays. When are working parents supposed to shop here? It's like they don't want our business."

**LiteraryLaurel**
"One of the last true literary bookstores. Don't listen to the complainers - this is a curated experience, not a warehouse. Eleanor's recommendations have never steered me wrong."

**Greg_T**
"Good store but feels like it's in decline. Fewer events than there used to be, inventory seems thin, not much energy. Hope they can turn it around."

### ★★★★☆ - 10 months ago
**UsedBookHunter**
"The used book section is underrated. Great prices and they actually know what they have. The rest of the store is hit or miss but I come back every month for the used books."

**NewToCorktown**
"Just moved to the neighborhood and so happy to have a real bookstore nearby. Saturday story time has been a great way to meet other parents. Already made friends here!"

**Anon**
"Tried to buy a gift card on their website. No e-commerce. Called to order over phone, they 'don't do that.' Drove there on my lunch break - closed on Mondays. Finally got there Tuesday, they didn't have the book I wanted and couldn't order it for pickup. HOW IS THIS STORE STILL OPEN?"

**TeacherMary**
"Brought my class here for a field trip. The staff was wonderful with the kids. Wish they had more inventory in the children's section but what they have is well-curated."

**RetiredEnglishProf**
"A dying breed. Where else can you discuss Proust with the owner? Eleanor's recommendations have expanded my reading for decades. Support this store or lose something irreplaceable."

**MysteryReader**
"Found a great local author here - some series set on Lake Michigan. The local authors section is why I keep coming back. Everything else I can get cheaper on Amazon but this is unique."
