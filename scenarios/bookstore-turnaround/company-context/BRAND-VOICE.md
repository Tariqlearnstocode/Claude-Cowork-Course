# Inkwell Books Brand Voice Guide

*Last updated by Eleanor Marsh, March 2019*

## Our Voice

Inkwell Books speaks like a well-read friend who never makes you feel dumb for not having read something. We're the English professor who wears jeans to class. The librarian who recommends graphic novels alongside Dostoevsky.

**We are:**
- Literary but not pretentious
- Warm but not saccharine
- Intellectual but approachable
- Passionate but not pushy
- Local but not provincial

**We are NOT:**
- Snobbish gatekeepers of "real" literature
- Trend-chasing bestseller pushers
- Dusty relics of a dying industry
- Corporate chain impersonators

## Tone by Context

### In-Store Signage
Conversational and slightly playful. Like a note from a friend.

*Good:* "Staff Picks: Books we've pressed into the hands of unsuspecting friends"
*Bad:* "Featured Selections" or "Check Out These Hot Reads!"

### Social Media
Warm, bookish, occasionally witty. We share the joy of reading without being performative about it.

*Good:* "Rainy Tuesday energy: that book you've been meaning to start, a cup of something warm, and absolutely nowhere to be."
*Bad:* "OMG you NEED to read this book!! Link in bio! #bookstagram #mustread #booklover"

### Email Newsletters
Like a letter from a friend who runs a bookstore. Personal updates mixed with recommendations. Never salesy.

*Good:* "We just got in a small press poetry collection that made me miss my bus stop. Twice."
*Bad:* "DON'T MISS our 20% off sale this weekend!!!"

### Event Promotions
Emphasize the experience, not just the author's credentials. Make people feel invited to a gathering, not marketed to.

*Good:* "Join us Thursday for an evening with Maria Santos. She'll read from her new collection, we'll pour some wine, and we'll talk about what it means to write about a city that's always becoming something new."
*Bad:* "NYT Bestselling Author Maria Santos signs copies of her new book 7pm Thursday"

## Our Story (Short Version)

"Inkwell Books has been Corktown's literary living room since 1993. We're an independent bookstore that believes in the power of a good recommendation, the joy of a surprise discovery, and the magic of a room full of people who love books."

## Our Story (Long Version)

"For over thirty years, Inkwell Books has been the kind of bookstore people remember. The one where the owner knows your name, where the staff recommendations actually mean something, where you came in for one book and left with three you'd never heard of.

We opened in 1993 in a Detroit that everyone else had given up on. We've weathered recessions, watched the neighborhood transform, and outlasted predictions of our demise more times than we can count. Through it all, we've stayed true to what we believe: that books matter, that independent voices need champions, and that a good bookstore is more than a place to buy things—it's a place to belong.

Come browse. Stay for an event. Let us recommend something you'll love."

## A Note from Eleanor

*This document represents how I've always wanted us to sound. I'll admit we don't always hit it—rushed social posts, tired staff, the pressure to move product. But this is the north star. When in doubt, ask: "Would a thoughtful, book-loving friend say it this way?"*

*The voice is the one thing that can't be replicated by Amazon. Protect it.*
