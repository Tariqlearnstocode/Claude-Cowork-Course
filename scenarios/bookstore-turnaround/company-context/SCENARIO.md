# Inkwell Books: The Turnaround Challenge

## Your Role

You've just been hired as the new General Manager of **Inkwell Books**, an independent bookstore in Detroit's Corktown neighborhood. The previous owner, Eleanor Marsh, ran the store for 31 years before retiring abruptly last month due to health issues. The building is owned by a small investment group who hired you to either turn the store around or prepare it for closure.

You have **90 days** to present a viable turnaround plan or the investors will sell the building to a developer who wants to convert it into luxury condos.

## The Situation

Inkwell Books is bleeding money. Sales are down 30% over the past two years, and the decline is accelerating. The store lost $47,000 last year and is on pace to lose $60,000 this year.

Eleanor left behind a mess of notes, half-finished projects, and contradictory information. Some staff members have quit, morale is low, and there's confusion about what the store should even be.

The investors have given you access to:
- All of Eleanor's notes and files
- Two years of sales data
- Customer feedback from various sources
- Competitor research Eleanor compiled
- Marketing ideas she never executed

Your job is to figure out:
1. **Why** is the store failing?
2. **What** is actually working (if anything)?
3. **How** can it be turned around?

## History of Inkwell Books

**1993** - Eleanor Marsh opens Inkwell Books in a small storefront on Michigan Avenue. Focus on literary fiction and poetry. Becomes a gathering spot for local writers.

**1998** - Expands into adjacent space after landlord offers favorable terms. Adds used books section and children's area.

**2003** - Survives initial Amazon threat by doubling down on events and community. Hosts 100+ author events per year. Known as "Detroit's literary living room."

**2008** - Financial crisis hits Detroit hard. Store survives by cutting staff and adding gift items.

**2012** - Brief renaissance as Detroit's recovery brings young professionals to Corktown. Sales peak at $892,000.

**2015** - Eleanor resists e-commerce. "Books should be discovered, not searched for."

**2018** - Barnes & Noble opens 15 minutes away. Amazon same-day delivery launches in Detroit.

**2020** - COVID forces 4-month closure. Reluctantly launches basic website with no e-commerce.

**2022** - Sales decline accelerates. Staff turnover increases. Eleanor becomes increasingly nostalgic and resistant to change.

**2024** - Eleanor retires. You arrive.

## What You're Working With

In the `inherited-chaos/` folder, you'll find everything Eleanor left behind:

- **previous-owner-notes.md** - Eleanor's rambling thoughts about the business
- **sales-data.csv** - Monthly sales broken down by category
- **customer-feedback/** - Comment cards, online reviews, email complaints
- **competitor-research/** - Info on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, other local stores
- **marketing-ideas/** - Campaign concepts Eleanor never finished
- **inventory-notes.md** - Eleanor's thoughts on what to stock

## Your Challenge

Dig through this chaos. Find the signal in the noise. The answer is in there somewhere - you just have to piece it together.

Some questions to guide your investigation:
- Which product categories are actually profitable?
- What do customers consistently praise vs. complain about?
- Where is Eleanor's perspective accurate vs. biased?
- What opportunities is the store missing?
- What should the store STOP doing?

Good luck. The clock is ticking.
