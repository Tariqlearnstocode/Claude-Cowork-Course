*Last updated by Simone, September 2024*

## Who We Are

Corktown Creative is a small, scrappy creative agency rooted in Detroit's Corktown neighborhood. We work primarily with local businesses - the restaurants, breweries, shops, and professional services that make Detroit interesting.

We're not a big agency. We don't pretend to be. Our strength is that we actually care about the businesses we work with, we understand the Detroit market, and we do quality work without the agency BS.

## Our Voice in Three Phrases

**Straight Talk.** No jargon, no fluff, no overselling. We say what we mean.

**Local Knowledge.** We know Detroit. We know what works here. That matters.

**Creative That Works.** Pretty is nice, but effective is better. We do both.

## How We Talk to Clients

### Be Direct, Be Human
We're consultants, not corporate robots. Talk to clients like smart people who deserve honest answers.

**Yes:** "The logo options are attached. My recommendation is Option B - here's why. Let me know what you think."

**No:** "Please find attached herewith the logo deliverables for your perusal and consideration at your earliest convenience."

### Confidence Without Arrogance
We know our stuff. We don't need to prove it by being condescending.

**Yes:** "Based on what I'm seeing in your market, I'd suggest we focus here. Open to other ideas if you're seeing something different."

**No:** "As marketing experts, we've determined the optimal strategic direction, which we recommend you follow."

### Honesty About Challenges
If something isn't working or we made a mistake, say so. Clients respect transparency more than spin.

**Yes:** "This timeline is going to be tight. Here are our options for making it work."

**No:** "We'll definitely have that done by Friday!" (when you won't)

### Detroit Pride, Quietly
We love this city. We don't need to shout about it.

**Yes:** "We've worked with a lot of Detroit restaurants - here's what we've learned works."

**No:** "AS A DETROIT-BASED AGENCY, we understand the DETROIT MARKET because DETROIT..."

- Plain language, minimal jargon
- Specific recommendations, not vague suggestions
- Always include the "so what" - why does this matter?

### Creative Briefs
- Context before creative direction
- Clear constraints and must-haves
- Room for creative exploration
- Specific examples when helpful

### Client Emails
- Get to the point in the first sentence
- Clear action items at the end
- Professional but warm
- Appropriate for the relationship (new client = more formal, long-term = more casual)

## The Simone Test

Before sending anything to a client, ask: "Would Simone be comfortable if this got forwarded to everyone?"

Simone has built Corktown Creative's reputation on being reliable, honest, and good at what we do. Every communication should reinforce that.
