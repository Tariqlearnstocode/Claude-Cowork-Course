# Freelancer/Consultant Chaos: Corktown Creative Collective

## Your Role

You are a **freelance marketing consultant** who just got an urgent call from Corktown Creative Collective, a small creative agency in Detroit's Corktown neighborhood. They need you to step in immediately to cover three client engagements. Today is Friday, January 17th.

## The Situation

The agency's lead consultant, Jordan Reeves, took a family emergency leave on Wednesday afternoon. Their laptop was left in the office, along with a mess of half-finished work. Jordan's out of contact for the foreseeable future - they're dealing with a serious family health situation and aren't responding to messages.

The agency owner, Simone Okafor, is panicking. She called you because you did some freelance work for Corktown Creative last year and she trusts you. Here's what she said on the phone:

*"I need someone who can walk into chaos and make sense of it. Jordan was managing three active clients - all of them are expecting updates Monday morning. I don't know what's been delivered, what's been promised, or what's still pending. Their files are a mess. Can you come in tomorrow and help me figure out what we're dealing with? I'll pay your day rate plus a chaos premium - just please help."*

You agreed. Tomorrow (Saturday) you're going to Simone's office to dig through Jordan's files and figure out the state of things.

## What You've Inherited

- Access to Jordan's project folders on the agency shared drive
- Email threads mid-conversation with clients
- Scope documents that may or may not reflect current agreements
- Half-finished deliverables (brand guidelines, marketing plans, copy)
- Time tracking data and billing records
- Jordan's personal notes (scattered and incomplete)
- Three clients expecting Monday updates

## The Three Active Clients

### 1. Bellevue Brewing Company
A craft brewery opening a new taproom in Eastern Market. They hired Corktown Creative for brand identity and launch marketing. The taproom opens February 15th.

### 2. Detroit Athletics Club
A local gym chain expanding from two to four locations. They need a rebrand and marketing strategy for the expansion. Board presentation is January 27th.

### 3. Rivertown Realty Group
A boutique real estate brokerage targeting young professionals. They want digital marketing and social media strategy. Been a client for 6 months but seems frustrated lately.

## Your Immediate Tasks

1. **Understand the current state of each project** - What's been delivered? What's pending? What's overdue?
2. **Find the actual agreements** - What did we promise? When? For how much?
3. **Identify urgent fires** - Who needs what by Monday? What can wait?
4. **Assess the deliverables** - Is Jordan's work any good? What needs to be redone vs. finished?
5. **Prepare a triage report** - Simone needs to know what she's dealing with

## What You Know About Corktown Creative

- Small creative agency (Simone plus 2-3 rotating freelancers/contractors)
- Focuses on branding, marketing strategy, and content for local businesses
- Good reputation but has been stretched thin lately
- Jordan has been their go-to lead consultant for about two years
- Simone handles business development and client relationships
- No project management system - everything is in folders, docs, and email

## The Stakes

These are real clients with real deadlines. If Monday's updates don't happen, Corktown Creative loses credibility - and possibly the clients themselves. Simone is counting on you to save these relationships.

For Bellevue Brewing, a botched launch could mean the difference between a successful opening and an empty taproom.

For Detroit Athletics, a missed board presentation could derail their expansion.

For Rivertown Realty, another dropped ball might be the last straw in an already strained relationship.

## Key Contacts

## A Note on Jordan

Jordan is (apparently) talented but disorganized. You'll see evidence of good strategic thinking alongside missed details and chaotic file management. Some things are brilliant, some things are barely started, and some things exist only as cryptic notes. Welcome to consulting.

*Your job: Dig through the chaos, understand what's real, and figure out how to get three clients to Monday without a disaster.*
