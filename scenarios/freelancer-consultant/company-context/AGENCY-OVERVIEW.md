# Corktown Creative Collective

## The Basics

**Location:** Corktown, Detroit, Michigan (co-working space in the Michigan Avenue building)
**Team:** 1 owner + rotating network of freelancers/contractors
**Focus:** Brand strategy, marketing, content for local businesses

## Who We Are

Corktown Creative Collective was founded by Simone Okafor after she spent eight years in marketing at larger Detroit agencies and got tired of watching local businesses get overcharged for mediocre work.

The "Collective" part is intentional - rather than maintaining expensive full-time staff, Simone works with a network of freelance designers, copywriters, and strategists. This keeps overhead low and lets her match the right people to each project.

Jordan Reeves has been the primary strategy consultant since 2022, handling most of the ongoing client work while Simone focuses on business development and client relationships.
