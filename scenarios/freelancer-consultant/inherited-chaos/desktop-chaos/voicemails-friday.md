## 9:52 AM - Marcus Bell

"Hey Jordan, it's Marcus. Just calling because I sent an email this morning and wanted to follow up. Look, I know you're busy, but I'm getting pretty anxious here. We're less than a month from opening and I still feel like I'm not 100% clear on where things stand.

Can you just... call me back? Even a five-minute conversation would help. My designer is asking me questions I can't answer. I feel like I'm bugging you but I don't know what else to do.

Okay. Call me. 313-555-0188. Thanks."

## 11:03 AM - Tanya Washington

"Hi, this is Tanya Washington from Detroit Athletics Club trying to reach Jordan Reeves. Jordan, I've sent a couple emails this week and I'm getting worried. Our board presentation is in 10 days and I was expecting a draft today.

Can you please call me back? Or email? Or anything? I need to know what's happening.

313-555-0163. Thanks."

## 2:15 PM - David Nguyen

"Jordan, David Nguyen. I'm going to be honest - I'm frustrated. I've been trying to reach you for a week. You missed our meeting yesterday. I'm paying $3,000 a month and I don't know what I'm getting for it anymore.

I've sent an email to Simone because I don't know what else to do. This isn't like you, so I hope everything's okay. But I need someone to call me back.

313-555-0177."

## 4:45 PM - Jordan's mom (for context)

"This is a message for Simone Okafor. My name is Patricia Reeves, I'm Jordan's mother. I wanted you to know that Jordan had to come to Ohio for a family emergency. Their father had a heart attack Wednesday afternoon. We're at the hospital now.

Jordan asked me to call because they've been unreachable and they felt bad about their clients. They said you would understand what to do.

I don't know when Jordan will be back or when they'll be able to work again. I'm sorry I don't have more information. You can reach me at 614-555-0234 if needed.

Thank you for understanding. Goodbye."
