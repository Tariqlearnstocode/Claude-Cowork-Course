## URGENT

## This Week

- [ ] Write the damn Rivertown blog post
- [ ] Create Nov + Dec analytics reports for Rivertown

## Honest Assessment

I'm underwater. Three clients, all with legitimate needs, and I've been underdelivering to all of them.

Options:
1. Pull all-nighters and dig out (not sustainable)
2. Talk to Simone about bringing in help (expensive, she might be mad I didn't flag sooner)
3. Have honest conversations with clients about timelines (they'll be disappointed)
4. Quit (lol but also...)

Need to prioritize:
- DAC has the hardest deadline (board meeting)
- Bellevue has the most money at stake and Marcus is stressed
- Rivertown is the most neglected but David has been patient

Maybe: Triage Rivertown (apologize, catch up on basics) and focus on DAC + Bellevue?
