## bellevue typography

Options discussed with Marcus:
1. Founders Grotesk - clean, versatile, modern craft
2. Trade Gothic - more industrial, very detroit
3. GT America - similar to founders but different weights
4. something custom?? no budget for this

Marcus liked the "could be on a neon sign" idea
That points to something bold and simple
Trade Gothic Bold Condensed might work

Need to show him options. Been procrastinating this decision.

## dac tagline brainstorm

Current: "Your Fitness. Your Way." (generic, could be anyone)

New ideas:
- "Local gym. Real community."
- "Fitness that fits Detroit."
- "Your neighborhood gym."
- "Real fitness. Real people. Really local."
- "Not a chain. A community."
- "Where everybody knows your gains" (lol no)
- "Detroit strong"
- "Locally owned. Community grown."

Problem: None of these are great. They're all... fine. Derek wants something memorable.

What about no tagline? Just a strong positioning statement?

## rivertown content ideas

I keep meaning to write these down properly but here's what I have:

- Market prediction piece (started, stuck)
- Neighborhood ranking (risky but engaging)
- "Day in the life of a Detroit realtor"
- Interview local business owners in neighborhoods with listings
- Client success stories (need to ask David)
- First-time buyer series
- Investment property content (David mentioned wanting to attract investors)

The problem isn't ideas, it's execution time.

## things I should tell simone

- I'm behind on all three clients
- Rivertown hasn't gotten what they're paying for
- DAC might miss the board deadline
- Bellevue scope crept and I didn't flag it
- I haven't taken a real day off in two months
- I think I might be burning out

But she's so busy and I don't want to be a problem...

## random

Mom's birthday is the 22nd. Don't forget.

Need to renew car registration.

That coffee shop in Corktown with the good scones - what was it called?

Is it too late to add buffer time to the Bellevue proposal? Probably yes.

## backup plan for dac

If I can't finish the deck:

1. Send Tanya what I have with an honest assessment
2. Ask if they can push the board meeting (probably not)
3. Have Simone help me finish (she'll be annoyed but she's good at strategy)
4. Hire someone to do design work fast (expensive)
5. ???

The competitive analysis is solid. The workshop notes are gold. The deck is just... not there yet.

## self-care (lol)

- Sleep more
- Eat something that isn't from a bag
- Go outside occasionally
- Stop checking email at 11pm
- Actually take the weekend off

*Written Jan 12. Ignore this because none of it will happen.*
