## Notes

**Bellevue:**
- Final $7,500 due when brand package is complete
- Scope says "on completion" but what counts as completion?
- Brand guidelines aren't done
- Social media work was added informally - do we bill for this?

**Detroit Athletics:**
- $6,000 due when Phase 3 (board presentation) is delivered
- Phase 4 ($10,000 total, $5k deposit) contingent on board approval
- If board approves, need to send Phase 4 agreement and invoice

**Rivertown:**
- They're paying every month on time via Stripe auto-billing
- But we're not delivering what we promised
- David hasn't threatened to cancel but... he probably should?
- Simone doesn't know how behind we are on this one

## Questions for Simone

- What's our policy when we're behind on deliverables but client keeps paying?
- Should we proactively credit Rivertown for the missed work?
- Bellevue scope creep - do we adjust the final invoice?
