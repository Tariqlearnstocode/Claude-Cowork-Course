Hi Jordan,

Great workshop last week! Derek was really energized by the conversation - he mentioned it in our leadership meeting today, which is a good sign.

I wanted to check in on next steps. The board meeting is January 27 (three weeks away) and Derek wants to present the new brand direction for approval before we commit to Phase 4 spending.

What's our timeline looking like for the presentation deck? I'm assuming you'll have a draft for us to review by... maybe the week of the 13th? That gives us time for revisions before the 27th.

Also - we discussed having some visual direction boards (mood boards? not sure the right term) to show the board what the new brand could look like. Is the designer you mentioned working on those?

Let me know!

Tanya

Hi Tanya,

So glad the workshop landed well! Derek's engagement was great - his passion for the local/community angle was really clear.

Re: timeline - yes, I'm targeting a draft for your review by end of next week (the 17th at the latest). That gives us a full week plus for revisions.

For visual direction: I'm working on briefing a designer this week. We'll have 2-3 mood board concepts to show the range of visual territory - from "modernized version of current" to "fresh start" - so the board can react.

Will keep you posted as things develop. Feel free to ping me if you have questions in the meantime.

Hey Jordan,

Quick check-in - how's the deck coming? Anything you need from me?

Derek asked me this morning when he'd see something. He's getting a little anxious (you know how it is before board meetings - everyone's on edge).

Also, just confirming - the 17th for the draft still works?

Tanya,

Yes, still on track! I've been heads-down in the deck. The strategy section is coming together well - the positioning work from the workshop translated nicely.

Quick question: Do you have the member survey data from last year's satisfaction survey? I remember you mentioned it in our kickoff but I don't think I ever got the file. Would love to pull a few stats to support the "community" positioning.

The 17th is still my target. I may send you a working draft end of this week for gut-check feedback before the full review version.

Mood boards are in progress - designer should have concepts to me by Thursday.

Attaching the survey data now - sorry, I thought I'd sent this before!

Looking forward to the gut-check draft. Even a rough outline would help me prepare Derek.

Hi Jordan,

Following up - did you end up sending that gut-check draft? I might have missed it.

The 17th is tomorrow and I want to make sure we're aligned on what I'll be reviewing.

Thanks,
Tanya

Jordan,

It's the 17th and I haven't received the deck or heard back from you. Is everything okay?

Derek is asking and I don't have answers for him. Please call or email me ASAP.

Simone,

I've been trying to reach Jordan for two days without success. Our board presentation is in 10 days and I haven't seen the brand strategy deck we were promised by today.

I don't want to be alarmist, but this is a significant presentation for us. Derek is putting his credibility on the line with the board by advocating for this rebrand investment. If we don't have a polished deck ready, it reflects poorly on all of us.

Can you please let me know what's happening? Is Jordan okay? Is someone else able to step in if needed?

I need to understand where we stand so I can manage expectations internally.

Thank you,
Tanya Washington
