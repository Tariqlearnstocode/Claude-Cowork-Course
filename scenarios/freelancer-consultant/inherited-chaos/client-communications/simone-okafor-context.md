## What Simone Told You

"I got three emails this morning - all from clients, all CCing me because they couldn't reach Jordan. That's when I knew something was wrong. Then Jordan's mom called the office - that's how I found out about the family emergency. Jordan's been unreachable since Wednesday afternoon.

I don't know the details. Something with their father. It's serious. Jordan dropped everything and drove to Ohio. They're not answering messages, which I get - I'm not going to harass someone dealing with a family crisis.

But I've got three clients who are expecting updates Monday. Marcus Bell is opening a taproom in a month. Tanya Washington has a board presentation in 10 days. And David Nguyen... honestly, I'm not even sure what's happening there, but his email sounded frustrated.

I pulled the client files from the shared drive. It's a mess. I can see Jordan was working on stuff but I don't know what's done, what's been delivered, what's been promised. There's no central tracking. It's just... folders within folders.

This is partly my fault. I should have been more on top of things. I knew Jordan was stretched thin. I just didn't know how thin.

Here's what I need from you: Come in tomorrow. Go through Jordan's files. Figure out what we're actually dealing with. I need to know:

1. What's the real status of each project?
2. What do clients think the status is?
3. What are the actual deliverables and deadlines?
4. What can we realistically do by Monday?

I'll pay your full day rate plus an extra $500 - call it a chaos premium. And if we need you beyond tomorrow, we can work that out.

I don't expect you to fix everything. I just need someone who can walk into this mess and tell me the truth about what we're dealing with. Then we can figure out a plan together.

Can you help me?"

## What Simone Doesn't Know

Based on your review of the files, there are some things Simone isn't aware of:

1. **Rivertown Realty is worse than she thinks.** Jordan's notes suggest they haven't delivered on the retainer scope for 2+ months. David has been patient, but the client relationship is at risk.

2. **The Detroit Athletics deck isn't close to ready.** Tanya thinks she's getting a review draft. What exists is more like an outline with a lot of [brackets].

3. **Jordan made some informal promises** that aren't in the scopes - like social media help for Bellevue and the menu design brief.

4. **Hours are over on Detroit Athletics.** Jordan's time tracking suggests they've exceeded the Phase 2 budget already.

## Simone's Priorities (Read Between the Lines)

From your history with Simone:

1. **Client relationships first.** She built this agency on trust. Losing any of these clients would hurt.

2. **Honesty over spin.** She'd rather know bad news early than be surprised.

3. **Don't promise what we can't deliver.** Simone hates the agency habit of over-promising.

4. **Protect Jordan's reputation (if possible).** Jordan isn't a bad person or consultant - they just got overwhelmed. Simone won't throw them under the bus.

5. **Keep it professional.** Whatever happened, the response should be calm, competent, and solution-focused.

## Your Job Tomorrow

1. **Audit everything.** Read all the files, emails, notes.
2. **Create a status document.** What's real, not what Jordan hoped for.
3. **Identify Monday fires.** What absolutely has to happen?
4. **Propose a triage plan.** How do we get through the next week without losing clients?

## Questions to Consider

- Can you actually fix this, or just stabilize it?
- Which client is the highest priority?
- What needs to happen before Monday morning?
- Should Simone reach out to clients proactively, or wait for you to assess?
- Is this a one-weekend problem or a longer engagement?
