Hey Jordan,

Happy New Year! Hope you had a good break.

Quick question - where are we on the brand guidelines? I know we said mid-January for the final version. I've got my interior designer asking about colors and fonts for the signage, and I want to make sure we're all aligned.

Also, have you thought any more about the social media plan? I know it wasn't officially in our scope but I'm getting nervous about the opening with basically zero social presence. We have 40 days until we open and we're invisible online.

Let me know when you have a few minutes to chat.

Marcus

Marcus!

Happy New Year to you too. Let's get this taproom launched!

Brand guidelines are in good shape - I'm targeting end of this week for a draft you can review. Should have everything your designer needs: final logo files, color specs (including Pantone for print), and typography direction.

On social media - you're right, we should talk about this. I have some ideas for a launch plan. Can we do a quick call later this week? I'll send some times.

Talk soon,
Jordan

Jordan,

Following up - it's Friday and I haven't seen the guidelines draft or gotten calendar times for our call. Everything okay?

My designer is getting antsy. She needs to order the tap handles and glassware with the logo on them, and there's a 4-week lead time. So we're running out of runway here.

Can you send what you have, even if it's not perfect? I just need to give her something to work with.

Marcus,

So sorry for the delay - this week got away from me. Sending you the draft guidelines now - see attached. It's about 70% there but should have what your designer needs for signage and merch.

Key things for her:
- Logo files are final (AI, EPS, PNG, SVG all included)
- Colors on page 8 - Pantone matching is TBD but hex codes are solid
- Typography - I'm recommending Founders Grotesk but want your sign-off

Let me know if there's anything specific she needs that isn't in there.

Re: social call - how about Tuesday at 2pm?

Jordan,

The attachment didn't come through - I don't see any file. Can you resend?

Tuesday at 2 works for me.

Ugh, sorry Marcus - technical difficulties. Trying again now.

**[Attachment: bellevue-brand-guidelines-v3-DRAFT.pdf - FILE NOT FOUND IN DRIVE]**

Let me know if it comes through this time. If not I'll send via Google Drive link.

Still on for tomorrow at 2?

Jordan,

Still no attachment. And I waited for you on the call yesterday at 2 - you didn't join and didn't respond to my text.

I'm trying to be patient here but we're a month out from opening and I feel like I'm chasing you for basic deliverables. Can you please just send me the files via Google Drive or Dropbox? And can we reschedule the call for today?

This is getting stressful.

Marcus

Marcus,

I'm so sorry. I completely spaced on our call - I had a conflict with another client and it slipped my mind. That's unacceptable and I apologize.

Here's the Drive link to the guidelines: [LINK]

I have to be honest with you - I'm more behind than I've let on. The guidelines are about 60-70% done, not 90% like I suggested. Typography isn't finalized, some sections are still placeholder text, and the applications section barely exists.

But your designer should have what she needs for the immediate stuff - logo files are final and colors are locked.

I know this isn't what you want to hear with the opening coming up. I'm going to make this right. Can we talk tomorrow morning?

Jordan,

I appreciate the honesty. I'd rather know where we actually stand than be surprised later.

Let's talk at 10am today. Here's what I need to understand:
1. What's actually done vs. not done
2. Realistic timeline to complete
3. What happens with the social media / launch marketing

I'll be blunt - I'm getting nervous. We've paid $7,500 for brand work that was supposed to be done by now. I trust Corktown Creative and Simone's recommendation, but I need to see a path forward.

I also need to loop in my designer (Lisa Chen - lisa@designstudiodetroit.com) so she's getting files directly from you. Too many things falling through the cracks with me as middleman.

Talk at 10.

Marcus

**Subject:** Urgent - Need update

Jordan (and Simone),

I haven't heard from Jordan since Wednesday and we had a call scheduled for yesterday that was also missed.

Simone - I don't know what's going on but I'm at the point where I need answers from someone at Corktown Creative. We're 29 days from our taproom opening and I have:
- Incomplete brand guidelines
- No social media presence or plan
- No menu design brief for my designer
- No communication for two days

I like Jordan and I've loved working with your team, but this is a critical time for my business and I can't be in the dark.

Can someone please call me today?
