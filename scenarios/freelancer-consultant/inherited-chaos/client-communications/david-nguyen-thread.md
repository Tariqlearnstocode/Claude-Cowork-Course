Hi Jordan,

Just checking in - I noticed we haven't published a blog post this month yet. Are we still planning to do the year-end market predictions piece we discussed?

Also, I haven't seen the November analytics report. Did I miss it?

Let me know - and happy holidays!

David

Happy New Year, Jordan.

Following up on my email from before the holidays. Still haven't seen:
- December blog post (or a draft to review)
- November analytics report
- December analytics report

I also noticed our social posting was pretty sparse over the holidays. I understand people take time off, but we had talked about scheduling content in advance.

Can we schedule a call to discuss? I'd like to understand what's happening and whether the retainer is still the right setup for both of us.

David,

Happy New Year! Apologies for the delayed response - was out last week and playing catch-up.

You're right that we fell behind on a few things in December. Let me be honest: I took on a couple of larger projects in Q4 that stretched my bandwidth more than I anticipated. Rivertown didn't get the attention it deserved, and I'm sorry for that.

Here's what I'm doing to get back on track:
- Blog post: I have a draft on the market predictions piece. Will finish and send for your review by end of this week.
- Analytics: I'll get November and December reports to you by Friday.
- Social: I'm front-loading content for January so we don't have gaps.

I also want to schedule our Q4/Q1 strategy review - I know we said early January. How about next week?

Let me know your availability.

Jordan

Jordan,

I appreciate the honesty. That's actually refreshing - I could tell something was off and I'd rather know than guess.

Next week for a strategy review works. How about Thursday the 16th at 10am?

A few things I want to discuss:
1. Whether the current scope still makes sense, or if we need to adjust
2. ROI - I've been investing $3k/month for 6 months, and I'd like to understand what I'm getting
3. Upcoming priorities - I have a few listings coming that I want to feature

I'm not looking to cancel or anything - I just want to make sure we're both getting value from this relationship.

Talk soon,
David

Thursday the 16th at 10am works perfectly. I'll send a calendar invite.

I hear you on all three points and I'm looking forward to the conversation. I think there's an opportunity to refocus the engagement around what's actually driving results for you.

In the meantime, I'll get you those reports and the blog draft.

Thanks for the grace, David. I know I've been dropping balls and I want to make it right.

**Subject:** Missed our meeting

Jordan,

I was on the call at 10am for our strategy review. You didn't join, and you haven't responded to my text.

I've now been waiting nearly a month for deliverables you promised. I've been patient because I believe in the partnership, but this is becoming a pattern.

I need to hear from you today, or I'm going to have to reach out to Simone directly.

**Subject:** Rivertown Realty retainer - concerns

Simone,

I've been a Corktown Creative client since July, working with Jordan on our digital marketing retainer. I've always appreciated your agency's approach and Jordan has done good work for us.

However, I need to raise some concerns:

1. I haven't received our monthly reports since October
2. Our December blog post was never delivered
3. Social posting has been sporadic for two months
4. Jordan missed a scheduled strategy meeting yesterday with no notice
5. I haven't been able to reach Jordan for nearly a week

I'm paying $3,000/month for services I'm not receiving. I don't want to make demands or threats - I'd genuinely like to resolve this. But I need to understand what's happening and whether we should continue this engagement.

Can we talk?
