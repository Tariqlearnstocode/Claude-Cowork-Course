2. What we learned
3. Where we need to go
4. How we get there
5. Investment & timeline

---

## SLIDE 3: The Opportunity

"Detroit Athletics Club is at an inflection point..."

[need to write the narrative here - something about expansion being a chance to evolve the brand]

---

## SLIDE 4: What We Learned (Research Summary)

Member Survey Highlights:
- 87% would recommend to a friend
- "Community" mentioned in 64% of positive comments
- Top reasons for choosing: location, price, atmosphere
- Top complaints: outdated facilities, inconsistent experience

Competitive Insight:
- Market is polarizing (budget vs. premium)
- Local/community positioning is ownable
- Boutique prices aren't necessary for boutique experience

[add more data points from Tanya's research]

---

## SLIDE 5: Current Brand Perception

**What members say:**
- "It feels like a neighborhood gym"
- "The staff actually knows me"
- "Not fancy, but real"

**What non-members say:**
- "Never heard of it"
- "Is that the one on [street]?"
- "Logo looks kind of dated"

[need actual quotes - check the research doc]

## SLIDE 6: The Strategic Challenge

[DIAGRAM NEEDED]

Detroit Athletics needs to:
1. Modernize without losing authenticity
2. Expand without losing community feel
3. Compete without copying competitors

---

## SLIDE 7: Brand Positioning

**Recommended positioning statement:**

"For Detroiters who want more from their gym than just equipment, Detroit Athletics Club is the local fitness community that [something about real relationships, actual community, not corporate...]"

[this isn't right yet. need to workshop]

DRAFT OPTIONS:

Option A: "Your neighborhood gym, elevated"
- Keeps the community feel
- Promises improvement
- Risk: sounds like we're admitting we're not good

Option B: "Real fitness. Real community. Really Detroit."
- Emphasizes authenticity
- Three-part structure
- Risk: "really Detroit" might be too casual

Option C: [need a third option]

---

## SLIDE 8: Brand Pillars

1. **COMMUNITY FIRST**
   - We're not a membership, we're a neighborhood
   - Staff relationships matter
   - Members know members

2. **LOCALLY ROOTED**
   - Detroit owned, Detroit focused
   - Decisions made here, not at corporate
   - Part of the neighborhood

3. **HONESTLY GOOD**
   - Quality without pretension
   - Fair pricing, real value
   - No BS fitness

4. **[FOURTH PILLAR?]**
   - Something about growth/improvement?
   - Or accessibility?

---

## SLIDE 9: Brand Architecture

[THIS IS ROUGH]

**Master Brand:** Detroit Athletics Club

**Location Strategy Options:**

A) Single unified brand
   - Detroit Athletics Club - Midtown
   - Detroit Athletics Club - Royal Oak
   - etc.

B) Neighborhood-forward
   - Detroit Athletics Midtown
   - Detroit Athletics Royal Oak
   - (drop "Club" from location names?)

C) Distinct location personalities
   - Each location has unique character within master brand
   - e.g., Downtown = professional, Ferndale = creative
   - (this seems complicated)

RECOMMENDATION: [haven't decided]

## SLIDE 15: Discussion / Q&A

[closing slide]

# NOTES TO SELF

## What's missing from this deck:

- Real data visualization (not just bullet points)
- Competitive examples (visual)
- Mood boards / visual direction boards
- Implementation timeline graphic
- Investment/ROI slide needs work
- Need to actually decide on positioning recommendation
- Need to actually decide on architecture recommendation
- The whole visual direction section is basically a placeholder
- Tanya hasn't seen this yet
- Simone hasn't reviewed
- NO DESIGNER BRIEFED on visual work

## Timeline reality check:

Board meeting is Jan 27.
Today is Jan 15.
I have 12 days but also two other clients.
This deck is maybe 40% done???

## Tanya's last email said:

"Looking forward to seeing the draft! Derek is anxious to understand where we're headed before presenting to the board."

I told her I'd have something "by end of week"... that was last week. ugh.

## What would make this good:

- Actual design work, not just words
- Tight, clear recommendations (not "options")
- Real data/proof points
- A compelling narrative
- Something they can present confidently

## What this is currently:

- A rough outline with lots of [brackets]
- Multiple unresolved decisions
- No visual assets
- Not ready for client eyes
