## Implications for Rebrand

1. **"Community" is the real differentiator** - lean into this hard
2. **Facility concerns are real but not dealbreakers** - acknowledge and address
3. **Local/Detroit identity matters** - members value it even if we don't promote it
4. **Staff relationships are key** - highlight the human element
5. **Price is part of value prop** - don't go too premium in positioning
