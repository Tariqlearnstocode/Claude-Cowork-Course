# Detroit Athletics Club
## Brand Positioning Workshop Notes

**Date:** January 9, 2025
**Location:** DAC Midtown Conference Room
**Attendees:** Derek Chen (CEO), Tanya Washington (Marketing), Simone Okafor (CCC), Jordan Reeves (CCC)

---

## Workshop Objectives

1. Align on brand challenges and opportunities
2. Explore positioning territory
3. Define what makes DAC different
4. Get input for brand strategy development

---

## Opening Discussion

Simone led intro, explaining workshop goals. Derek seemed engaged but checking phone periodically (later mentioned board pressure about expansion timeline).

Key quote from Derek: "We started this gym because we hated the big box experience. Somewhere along the way, we stopped telling that story."

---

## Exercise 1: Brand Obituary

"If Detroit Athletics Club closed tomorrow, what would the headline be?"

**Derek's answer:** "Local Gym Closes - Regulars Lose Their Second Home"

**Tanya's answer:** "Midtown Fitness Community Loses Its Heart"

Interesting - both focused on community/belonging, not fitness results or facilities.

---

## Exercise 2: Competitor Sort

Asked them to sort competitors into categories:

**"Would consider joining":**
- LIFT Detroit (Tanya)
- Burn Fitness (both)

**"Would never join":**
- Planet Fitness (both)
- Powerhouse (Tanya - "too intimidating")

**Discussion:** They respect boutique concepts but find them too expensive. They see budget gyms as "depressing." DAC wants to be the quality option at accessible prices.

---

## Exercise 3: Brand Attributes

"Which words describe DAC today vs. where you want to be?"

| TODAY | ASPIRATIONAL |
|-------|--------------|
| Friendly | Welcoming |
| Local | Community Hub |
| Affordable | Great Value |
| Dated | Modern Classic |
| Hidden Gem | Known Destination |
| Comfortable | Inspiring |

Big gap between "dated" and "modern classic" - this is the visual challenge.

## Exercise 4: The Onlyness Statement

"Detroit Athletics Club is the ONLY _____ that _____."

**Attempts:**

1. "The only locally-owned gym chain that actually feels like a neighborhood gym"

2. "The only gym that combines quality facilities with genuine community at a fair price"

3. "The only Detroit-owned fitness community where members become family"

Derek pushed back on "family" - "that's what everyone says." Fair point.

Best version from workshop:
**"Detroit Athletics Club is the only locally-owned gym that offers real community without boutique prices."**

Still needs work but direction is clear.

## Discussion: Expansion Concerns

Derek worried that adding locations will dilute the community feel. "If we're in four places, are we still a neighborhood gym?"

Simone suggested: "The brand should be 'local' in attitude, not just geography. Each location serves its neighborhood while sharing values."

This became an important strategic point - need to address in brand architecture.

---

## Closing: Top 3 Priorities

Asked each person for their #1 brand priority:

**Derek:** "Don't let growth make us generic. We're local first."

**Tanya:** "Look modern without looking like everyone else. We need our own style."

**Simone:** "Tell the story. You have 15 years of community - that's your differentiator."

---

## My Takeaways (Jordan)

1. The "community" insight is real and should be central
2. They're afraid of losing their identity in expansion
3. Visual modernization is a must but authenticity matters
4. Derek needs to feel like it's still "his" brand
5. Tanya is the champion internally - keep her excited
6. The "local" positioning is ownable but needs to be more than a claim
