## Executive Summary

The Detroit metro fitness market is crowded with national chains and emerging boutique concepts. Detroit Athletics Club occupies a differentiated position as a locally-owned, community-focused gym, but this positioning is under-communicated and at risk as competitors expand.

```

Detroit Athletics is positioned middle-market on price with full-service facilities. The risk is being "stuck in the middle" - not cheap enough to compete with budget options, not premium enough to compete with boutique.

## Competitive Positioning Recommendation

Detroit Athletics should own the **"Local Gym, Real Community"** position:

- More personal than chains
- More accessible than boutiques
- Authentically Detroit
- Community over corporate

Key differentiators to emphasize:
1. Local ownership and decision-making
2. Real community (not manufactured)
3. Quality facilities at fair prices
4. Staff who know your name

---

## Implications for Rebrand

1. **Don't try to look like a boutique** - Own the accessible, real, local position
2. **Modernize without sanitizing** - Updated look that still feels genuine
3. **Tell the Detroit story** - Local roots are a real advantage
4. **Emphasize community proof** - Member stories, longevity, relationships
