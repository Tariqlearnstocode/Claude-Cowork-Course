- Inconsistent with Midtown branding

### Digital Presence

**Website:**
- Functional but outdated design

## Competitive Brand Comparison

| Element | DAC | LIFT Detroit | Burn Fitness | Planet Fitness |
|---------|-----|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Logo Quality | C | A | B+ | B |
| Visual System | D | A | B | A |
| Consistency | D | A | B | A (corporate) |
| Differentiation | C | A | B | B |
| Digital Presence | C | A | B+ | A |

DAC's brand is objectively weaker than competitors. Not a death sentence, but noticeable.

## What's Working

1. **The name** - "Detroit Athletics Club" sounds established, local, community-oriented
2. **Staff relationships** - Not a brand element, but brand-relevant
3. **Member loyalty** - Despite weak branding, members stay
4. **Location quality** - Physical spaces are good, branding undersells them
5. **Local reputation** - Word of mouth is strong

---

## What's Not Working

1. **Visual identity is dated** - Looks like 2012 because it is from 2012
2. **No consistency** - Each touchpoint feels different
3. **Generic positioning** - Nothing says "this is DAC" vs. any other gym
4. **Missed opportunity** - Local/community story isn't being told
5. **Expansion risk** - If they add locations without fixing this, it gets worse

---

## Recommendations

### Quick Wins (Rebrand or Not)
- Consistent social media voice
- Better photography (members, not stock)
- Template system for flyers/posts
- Staff brand training

### Rebrand Elements (If Approved)
- New logo and visual identity
- Color palette that photographs well
- Typography system
- Brand guidelines for consistency
- Template library
- Signage guidelines for expansion

### Positioning Opportunity
"The local gym that actually feels local" - lean into community, Detroit roots, staff relationships. This is real and competitors can't copy it.

---

## Conclusion

Detroit Athletics Club has strong fundamentals (loyal members, good facilities, caring staff) wrapped in a weak brand. The expansion is an opportunity - maybe an excuse - to fix this. The new locations should open with a unified, stronger brand, and existing locations should be updated.

The risk of doing nothing: New locations look disconnected. Competitors look more professional. The "local gym" story never gets told.
