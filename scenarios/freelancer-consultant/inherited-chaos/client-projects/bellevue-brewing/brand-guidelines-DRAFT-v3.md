## 1. Brand Story

### Our Beginning

Bellevue Brewing was born from [NEED TO GET THIS FROM MARCUS - something about homebrewing hobby turning into passion?? he told me the story but I didn't write it down]

### Our Mission

To craft exceptional beer that brings people together, rooted in Detroit's spirit of creativity and community.

### Our Values

**Craft** - Every batch matters. We don't cut corners.

**Community** - Beer is social. Our taproom is your living room.

**Detroit** - We're not just in Detroit, we're of Detroit. [this feels weak, need better language]

**[Need a fourth value? Or keep it at three?]**

The Bellevue Brewing logo features a stylized "B" formed from intertwining hop vines, representing the craft and growth at the heart of our brand.

**Reversed** - For dark backgrounds and merchandise

## 4. Typography

### Primary Typeface: [UNDECIDED]

Options we discussed:
1. Founders Grotesk - clean, modern, good for craft brands
2. Trade Gothic - industrial feel, very Detroit
3. Something more hand-drawn? Marcus liked the idea of warmth

**Heading use:** [TBD]
**Body use:** [TBD]

### Secondary Typeface

For body copy and longer text: [probably a serif? Need to pair this]

[THIS WHOLE SECTION NEEDS WORK]

---

## 5. Photography Style

### Guidelines

- Real people, real moments
- Warm, golden lighting preferred
- Focus on craft details (hands pouring, hops, equipment)
- Community moments in taproom
- Detroit industrial aesthetic when appropriate

### What to Avoid

- Stock photo look
- Over-styled food photography
- Heavily filtered Instagram aesthetic
- Anything that looks "corporate"

[NEED EXAMPLE IMAGES - mood board exists somewhere]

---

## 6. Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice

**Knowledgeable but not snobby** - We know beer. We don't gatekeep.

**Warm and welcoming** - The taproom is for everyone, the brand should feel that way.

**Proudly Detroit** - We rep our city without being corny about it.

### Writing Examples

**Menu descriptions:**
> "Our flagship IPA. Citrus forward, balanced bitter finish. Perfect for the friend who says they 'don't like IPAs.'"

**Social media:**
> [need examples]

**Email:**
> [need examples]

*Notes to self:*
- Get Marcus to approve typography direction ASAP

- Photography section needs real images, not just descriptions
- Applications section is really just placeholders right now
- Is 20-30 pages realistic? This might end up shorter
