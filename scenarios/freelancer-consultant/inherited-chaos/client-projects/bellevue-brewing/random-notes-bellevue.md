# random bellevue notes

## from kickoff meeting oct 15

- marcus has been brewing for 12 years, started in garage in ferndale
- wife sarah handles operations/finance
- taproom is 3,500 sq ft in eastern market, used to be a machine shop
- keeping some industrial elements - brick, exposed ductwork
- 12 taps to start, might add 4 more later
- hours will be thurs-sun to start, maybe expand
- no kitchen but partnering with food trucks
- across from the big shed market

## logo feedback dec 3

marcus and sarah liked direction 3 best - "feels more established but still crafty"
didn't like direction 1 - "too hipster, looks like every other brewery"
direction 2 was close but the hop illustration felt "too busy"

they want the final logo to feel like it could be on a neon sign. classic but modern.

## brand positioning from strategy deck

"Bellevue Brewing is the Eastern Market neighborhood brewery - a place where serious craft meets genuine community. For Detroiters who appreciate quality beer and authentic experiences."

wait did they approve this exact language? I think so?

## stuff marcus mentioned wanting (not in scope)

- signage coordination with interior designer
- help with menu layout (we agreed to do a "brief" - what does that even mean?)
- grand opening planning (events are not our thing but he keeps asking)
- email newsletter setup (not in scope but critical)
- merchandise design (definitely not us)

## competitor notes

- other eastern market brewery options are limited
- atwater in rivertown is bigger/established
- batch brewing in corktown is probably closest comparison
- marcus wants to be more "neighborhood" than those

## brand guidelines progress

- logo: done
- colors: mostly done, need pantone
- type: STUCK on this, need to decide
- photography: have direction, no examples
- voice: started, needs work
- applications: basically nothing
