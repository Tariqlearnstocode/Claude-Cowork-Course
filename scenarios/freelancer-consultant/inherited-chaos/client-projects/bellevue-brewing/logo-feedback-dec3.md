# Logo Presentation Feedback
## December 3, 2024 - Client Call

**Attendees:** Marcus Bell, Sarah Bell, Jordan Reeves (phone)

---

## Direction 1: "Craft Modern"

Clean, minimalist wordmark with subtle hop accent.

**Marcus:** "This feels too generic. Could be any brewery. It's nice but there's nothing Detroit about it."

**Sarah:** "I like the simplicity but agree it doesn't feel like us."

**Verdict:** Not selected

---

## Direction 2: "Industrial Heritage"

Bold, stacked type with decorative border. Eastern Market warehouse aesthetic.

**Marcus:** "I love the concept but it feels busy. The border is too much. Maybe a simplified version?"

**Sarah:** "The typography is great but the whole thing feels heavy."

**Verdict:** Liked elements, too busy overall

---

## Direction 3: "Neighborhood Brewery"

Confident, slightly vintage wordmark with stylized "B" icon that incorporates hop imagery.

**Marcus:** "This is the one. It feels established but not old. Like we've been here for 20 years even though we haven't opened yet."

**Sarah:** "I can see this on a neon sign. That was the test, right?"

**Discussion:** They specifically liked:
- The weight of the type (bold but not heavy)
- The icon could stand alone on merchandise
- The "B" has character without being gimmicky
- Works in one color (important for printing)

**Verdict:** SELECTED

---

## Refinement Requests

1. **Tighten the kerning** on "BREWING" - feels slightly loose
2. **Consider the "B" icon** - can it be slightly less symmetrical? Marcus wants "handcrafted" feel
3. **Test it horizontal** - current is stacked, would horizontal work for some applications?
4. **Color treatment** - show it in the gold we discussed, plus black, plus cream

---

## Next Steps (as discussed)

- Jordan to work with designer on refinements
- Second round review by Dec 10
- Final logo files by Dec 15

---

## Notes

Marcus mentioned wanting to use the icon on tap handles and merchandise early. Sarah reminded him the taproom isn't open yet.

They're excited. This was a good call.
