## Slide 1: Title

Bellevue Brewing Company
Brand Strategy
Prepared by Corktown Creative Collective

---

## Slide 2: Who We Are

Bellevue Brewing is a craft brewery born from a homebrewer's 12-year obsession with making great beer and a belief that Detroit's Eastern Market deserves a neighborhood brewery.

**Founder:** Marcus Bell
**Location:** Eastern Market, Detroit
**Opening:** February 2025

---

## Slide 3: What We Believe

**Craft Matters**
Every batch, every pour, every detail.

**Community First**
A taproom should feel like your living room with better beer.

**Detroit Proud**
We're not just in Detroit. We're of Detroit.

---

## Slide 4: Positioning

For Detroiters who want more than just a drink,
Bellevue Brewing is the Eastern Market neighborhood brewery
that brings serious craft and genuine community together
in a space that feels like home.

**Unlike** big production breweries or trendy beer bars,
**we** keep it real, keep it local, and keep the taps interesting.

## Slide 5: Target Audience

**Primary: The Craft Curious**
- Ages 28-45
- Appreciates good beer but not a snob
- Values authenticity and local businesses
- Lives in or around Detroit, works downtown or midtown
- Looking for a "third place" that isn't their couch

**Secondary: The Market Crowd**
- Eastern Market regulars
- Tourists and visitors
- Food-and-drink explorers

## Slide 6: Brand Personality

If Bellevue Brewing were a person, they'd be:

- **Knowledgeable** but not pretentious
- **Warm** and genuinely welcoming
- **Proudly Detroit** without being corny
- **Quality-obsessed** but unpretentious
- **The friend** who always knows the best local spots

## Slide 7: Competitive Position

[Chart showing Bellevue positioned as "Authentic/Local" and "Community-Focused" vs. competitors like Atwater (larger/production), Batch Brewing (similar but Corktown), and generic sports bars (mainstream)]

**Our territory:** The authentic neighborhood brewery

---

## Slide 8: Visual Direction

**Recommended direction:** Modern Craft Heritage

- Clean, confident typography
- Rich, warm color palette (gold, copper, black)
- Nods to industrial/Detroit history without cliche
- Photography that feels real, not staged
- "Could be on a neon sign" test for logo

---

## Slide 9: Brand Voice

**Tone:** Knowledgeable but approachable. Think a well-read friend, not a professor.

**Examples:**
- "Our flagship IPA. Citrus forward, bitter finish. Perfect for people who think they don't like IPAs."
- "Thursdays at Bellevue. Your coworkers might be here. Your in-laws probably won't."
