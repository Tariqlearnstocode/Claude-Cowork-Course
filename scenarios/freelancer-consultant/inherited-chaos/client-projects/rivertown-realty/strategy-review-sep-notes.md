## Performance Review

### Social Media (Jul-Sep)
- Instagram followers: 1,247 → 1,412 (+13%)
- Facebook followers: 892 → 934 (+5%)
- LinkedIn followers: 324 → 398 (+23%)
- Average engagement rate: 3.2% (industry average ~2%)

**David's reaction:** "Numbers look good but I'm not sure I'm seeing it translate to leads."

### Blog Performance
- 3 posts published
- Average views: ~180
- Average time on page: 2:15
- Top post: "Top 5 Detroit Neighborhoods for First-Time Buyers" (420 views)

**David's reaction:** Positive, wants more content like the neighborhoods piece.

### Leads Attributed
- Hard to track directly
- David mentioned 2-3 people who said they found him through social
- Blog driving some email signups

---

## What's Working

- Neighborhood content performs well
- LinkedIn getting traction with professional audience
- Consistent presence (at this point we were consistent)
- David's personal posts when he shares our content

## What's Not Working

- Instagram reach has declined (algorithm changes?)
- Not enough listing content (David's responsibility to send)
- Blog SEO taking time to build
- Hard to measure ROI directly

---

## Q4 Priorities (Agreed)

1. **More neighborhood content** - David suggested a series
2. **Year-end market predictions** - Timely for Q4
3. **Holiday-related content** - Tasteful, not cheesy
4. **Push for testimonials** - David will gather
5. **LinkedIn focus** - Where serious buyers are

## David's Feedback

"Overall I'm happy with the direction. I know social media is a long game. My only concern is making sure we're reaching the right people, not just getting likes from other agents."

"I'd love to see us get more creative. Some of what we're posting feels a bit... expected?"

---

## Action Items

- [ ] Jordan: Develop neighborhood series concept
- [ ] David: Send listing photos/details more proactively
- [ ] Jordan: Draft Q4 content calendar
- [ ] David: Identify clients for testimonials
- [ ] Both: Brainstorm "creative" content ideas

## Next Quarterly Review

Scheduled for early January 2025

**Post-meeting note (Jordan):**

David was positive but there's an undercurrent of "is this worth $3k/month?" Not explicit, but I can feel it. Need to make sure Q4 delivers.

---

*Q4 content calendar: Did I ever send this? Check drafts.*

*October note: Getting stretched thin with DAC starting. Need to stay on top of Rivertown.*

*November note: Falling behind. David hasn't complained yet but...*

*December note: Definitely behind. Skipping this month's report, will catch up in January.*

*January note: David emailed. Not good.*
