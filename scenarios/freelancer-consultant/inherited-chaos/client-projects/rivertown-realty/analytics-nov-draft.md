## Honest Assessment

November was below standard. The content we did publish performed okay, but we didn't hit our targets:
- Posted 7/12 on Instagram (58%)
- Posted 6/12 on Facebook (50%)
- Posted 0/1 blog (0%)

**Reasons:**
- Increased workload on other projects
- Holiday schedule (but this shouldn't excuse it)
- No proactive content calendar created for the month

---

## Recommendations

1. Front-load December content to catch up
2. Schedule posts in advance using Later
3. [other things I should recommend but won't actually do]

---

**NOTES:**

This is the draft I started but never sent. David asked about November report in December. I said I'd send it. I didn't.

Now it's January and I haven't sent November OR December reports.

This is bad.

*Do I send this now? Or just include it in a combined Nov/Dec/Jan catch-up?*
