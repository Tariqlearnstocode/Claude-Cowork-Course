# jordan's notes - READ THIS FIRST

*updated wed jan 15 before I left*

sorry this is such a mess. family emergency, had to leave fast. here's what I can tell you about what's happening with clients

## bellevue brewing

this is the big one. marcus is a great guy but he's STRESSED about the taproom opening feb 15.

what's done:
- brand strategy deck (they approved this in november)
- logo concepts - they picked direction 3, I think? need to check email
- color palette and typography (in the brand guidelines draft)

what's NOT done:
- final brand guidelines - like 60% done?? in the drive
- social media launch plan - I started an outline
- menu design brief for their designer - haven't started
- grand opening event plan - haven't started
- email list setup - they keep asking about this

he's expecting monday update on the brand guidelines. I told him they'd be done by end of this week... that was before I knew I was leaving

BUDGET: we quoted $15k for the full brand package. $7,500 paid, $7,500 due on completion. should be fine but the scope has crept a bit - I've been doing extra stuff without tracking

## detroit athletics

tanya is amazing but the project is a mess. their board meeting is jan 27 and they need the rebrand presentation ready.

what's done:
- competitive analysis (pretty thorough actually)
- brand audit of current stuff
- positioning workshop notes (simone led this one)

what's NOT done:
- new brand strategy deck - started but it's rough
- brand architecture document - ??? not sure what this even is supposed to include
- visual direction boards - waiting on designer, did I even brief them??
- board presentation - NOT STARTED

tanya thinks we're further along than we are. I may have been... optimistic in our last check-in.

BUDGET: $22k project, $11k paid. we're probably over on hours already. don't tell simone yet.

## rivertown realty

david is frustrated and I don't blame him. this retainer has been a disaster.

what's supposed to happen:
- 3 social posts/week
- 1 blog post/month
- monthly analytics report
- quarterly strategy review

what's actually happening:
- posts are sporadic, I've missed several weeks
- blog post is... december? november? I can't remember the last one
- haven't sent analytics in 2 months
- no strategy review since september

they're paying $3k/month for this and not getting $3k worth of value. david sent an email last week that I haven't responded to. it wasn't mean but you could tell he's done.

BUDGET: retainer so no overages, but we're definitely underdelivering. might lose this client tbh

---

## random stuff

- time tracking is in toggl, mostly accurate, probably some gaps
- scope docs are in the drive but they're not all up to date
- simone doesn't know how behind I am on rivertown. don't volunteer it. (or do, idk, it's your call now)

---

## passwords/logins

- drive access: simone can give you access
- toggl: ask simone
- client social accounts: passwords should be in a doc called "client logins" somewhere... maybe?

## i'm sorry

I know this is a mess. I know I should have been more organized. There's a lot of good work in there too, I promise - I just ran out of time to package it nicely.

If you need to reach me: probably don't. I'll be dealing with family stuff and I can't think about work right now. Sorry.

## updates wed 3pm

leaving now. mom called, it's serious. good luck with all this. some files got renamed when I was trying to organize, might have made it worse. sorry.
