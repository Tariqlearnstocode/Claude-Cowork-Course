# Restaurant Rebrand Scenario

## Your Role

You are **Jordan Mitchell**, the newly hired General Manager at **State Fair Cafe**, a beloved Detroit diner that's been serving the Corktown neighborhood for 25 years.

You started two weeks ago. The previous manager, Derek Chen, left abruptly after 8 months on the job. He was hired specifically to "modernize" the restaurant but departed mid-project, leaving behind a mess of research, half-finished plans, and a confused owner.

## The Situation

State Fair Cafe opened in 1999, founded by **Margaret "Maggie" Kowalski**, who still owns the restaurant. Maggie is 67 years old, semi-retired, and trusts you to figure out what to do next.

The problem: **revenue has declined 18% over the past three years.** Maggie panicked and hired Derek to attract younger customers. Derek had big ideas about turning State Fair Cafe into a trendy "elevated comfort food" spot. He ran surveys, researched competitors, tested new menu items, and redesigned the social media presence.

Then he left. No explanation. Just a two-sentence resignation email.

Now you're staring at his files trying to figure out:
1. What did Derek actually learn?
2. What should the restaurant actually do?
3. How do you pitch a direction to Maggie that makes sense?

## What You've Inherited

Derek's Google Drive folder (now your `inherited-chaos/` folder) contains:
- Scattered notes about his rebrand vision
- Customer survey data that seems to contradict itself
- Menu experiments with mixed results
- Competitor research on various restaurant types
- Social media analysis and review data
- An email thread with Maggie that goes in circles

## Your Goal

Analyze everything Derek left behind. Find the signal in the noise. Develop a clear recommendation for State Fair Cafe's future direction and prepare to pitch it to Maggie.

## Timeline

Maggie wants to meet with you in one week to discuss "the path forward." She's anxious. The restaurant is her life's work, and she doesn't want to see it fail—but she also doesn't want to destroy what made it special.

## Key Questions to Answer

- Should State Fair Cafe pursue a full rebrand?
- What do customers actually want?
- What's causing the revenue decline?
- What changes (if any) would actually help?
- How do you balance tradition with modernization?

*Good luck. The answers are in the chaos—you just have to find them.*
