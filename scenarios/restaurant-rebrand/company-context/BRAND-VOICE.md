## Derek's Proposed "New Direction"

*Note: These materials were found in Derek's files. Implementation status: unclear.*

### Proposed New Voice
- **Elevated but accessible**
- **Instagram-worthy**
- **Health-conscious options highlighted**
- **"Chef-driven" language**

### Proposed New Tagline
- "Classic Reimagined" (Derek's top choice)
- "The New Old School"
- "Comfort, Elevated"

### Sample New Marketing Copy (Derek's drafts)
> "Our house-made brioche French toast features locally-sourced maple syrup and a dusting of powdered sugar. A breakfast experience worth waking up for."

> "We're bringing craft cocktails to brunch. Try our signature Bloody Mary bar, featuring house-infused vodkas and farm-fresh garnishes."

> "State Fair Cafe 2.0: Same soul, new style. Follow our journey."

### Proposed Visual Updates
- **Colors:** Charcoal gray, white, copper accents
- **Fonts:** Modern sans-serif throughout
- **Imagery:** Overhead food shots, exposed brick, Edison bulbs
- **Logo:** Simplified wordmark, minimalist design

## The Tension

Maggie approved Derek's exploration but never formally approved implementation. Some changes were tested:
- New Instagram account created (low engagement)
- Three "elevated" menu items tested (mixed results)
- New staff uniforms ordered but never worn (still in boxes)

The current state is a confusing mix. The website shows the old branding. The Instagram shows Derek's new direction. The physical restaurant looks unchanged except for a few new menu table tents that don't match anything else.

## Questions for Consideration

- Does the current brand voice still work?
- Is Derek's proposed direction right for this restaurant?
- Is there a middle path?
- What do customers actually respond to?
