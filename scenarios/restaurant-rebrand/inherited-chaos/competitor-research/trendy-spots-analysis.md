# Competitor Analysis: Trendy Brunch Spots

*Focus: New Corktown/Detroit restaurants capturing young demographics*

---

## Folk Detroit

**Location:** 1701 Trumbull Ave (0.8 miles from State Fair Cafe)
**Opened:** 2016
**Type:** Modern American, farm-to-table
**Price range:** $$-$$$
**Avg check:** $22-28

### What they do well:
- **Instagram-perfect aesthetic** - Exposed brick, natural light, minimalist design
- **Seasonal, changing menu** - Creates urgency and repeat visits
- **Quality sourcing** - Local farms, house-made everything
- **Beverage program** - Craft cocktails, local coffee, fresh juices
- **Storytelling** - Every dish has a story, every ingredient is highlighted

### Typical customer:
- Age 25-40
- Higher income
- Food-motivated (willing to wait, travel, pay more)
- Socially active (posts about dining experiences)

### Weekend wait times: 45-90 minutes (they don't take reservations)

### Reviews analysis (Yelp, Google):
- 4.5 stars average
- Praise: "Beautiful food," "Worth the wait," "Best brunch in Detroit"
- Complaints: "Too expensive," "Portions are small," "Pretentious"

### Relevance to State Fair Cafe:
Folk is NOT our competition in the traditional sense. Different price point, different experience, different customer. BUT they are capturing customers who COULD be ours if we gave them a reason.

## Dime Store

**Location:** 719 Griswold St (Downtown, ~2 miles)
**Opened:** 2014
**Type:** Modern diner, elevated comfort food
**Price range:** $$
**Avg check:** $18-24

### What they do well:
- **Updated diner concept** - Classic dishes with twists
- **Accessible but elevated** - Not pretentious, but clearly "better" than traditional diner
- **Strong brand** - Consistent visual identity, memorable name
- **Multi-location** - Expanded to multiple Detroit-area spots

### Menu highlights:
- "The Dime" - Their signature breakfast
- Stuffed hash browns (Instagrammable)
- Craft cocktails at brunch

### Typical customer:
- Age 28-45
- Mix of young professionals and families
- Looking for "good but not too fancy"

### Reviews analysis:
- 4.3 stars average
- Praise: "Great food, fun vibe," "Reliably good," "Creative menu"
- Complaints: "Getting too corporate," "Long waits," "Inconsistent"

### Relevance to State Fair Cafe:
Dime Store is closer to what State Fair Cafe COULD become if we went the "elevated comfort food" route. But they have more resources, more locations, and a multi-year head start. Do we want to compete directly with them?

## Selden Standard

**Location:** 3921 2nd Ave (Midtown, ~2 miles)
**Opened:** 2014
**Type:** New American, small plates
**Price range:** $$$
**Avg check:** $40-55

### Not directly comparable but worth noting:
They've won James Beard attention for Detroit. They prove that Detroit diners will pay premium prices for quality food with good ambiance. But their model is completely different from ours.

### Relevance to State Fair Cafe:
Not a competitor. But proof that Detroit's dining scene has matured. Expectations have risen.

## Gold Cash Gold

**Location:** 2100 Michigan Ave (0.3 miles from State Fair Cafe!)
**Opened:** 2015
**Type:** Southern-influenced American
**Price range:** $$-$$$
**Avg check:** $28-35

### What they do well:
- **Atmosphere** - Beautifully renovated old building
- **Quality food** - Southern comfort done well
- **Neighborhood presence** - Active in Corktown community
- **Evening service** - Dinner/bar scene, not just brunch

### Relevance to State Fair Cafe:
This is our CLOSEST trendy competitor. They're 0.3 miles away. They're capturing the Corktown newcomers we're not. They prove our location is viable for an elevated concept.

BUT: They're dinner-focused, we're breakfast-focused. Potential for coexistence?

## Key Takeaways from Trendy Spots

### What they all share:
1. **Strong visual identity** - Everything is intentional
2. **Quality focus** - Ingredients, preparation, presentation
3. **Social media presence** - Active, engaging, photogenic content
4. **Modern conveniences** - Online ordering, modern POS, seamless payment
5. **Storytelling** - They make you feel like you're part of something
6. **Atmosphere investment** - Design matters, lighting matters, details matter

### What State Fair Cafe would need to compete directly:
- Major renovation ($100k+)
- Menu overhaul
- New brand identity
- New pricing strategy
- Staff training
- Time to build reputation

### The question:
Do we WANT to compete with these places? Or do we occupy a different niche?

Maybe State Fair Cafe's competition isn't Folk or Dime Store. Maybe our competition is apathy - people just not thinking of us at all.

## Observation

The trendy spots don't actually have that many regulars. They have customers who visit occasionally for a "nice brunch out."

State Fair Cafe has regulars who come DAILY.

That's a different business model. Maybe a better one, if we can grow the base.

Something to think about.
