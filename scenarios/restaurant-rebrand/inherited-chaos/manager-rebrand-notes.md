## Big Picture Vision

State Fair Cafe is stuck in the past. That's the problem but also potentially the opportunity?? Need to figure out which.

Corktown is CHANGING. Young professionals, artists, tech workers. They want:
- Instagrammable food
- Craft coffee
- Healthier options
- Cool vibes

Current customers are dying. Literally. Average regular is 65+. That's not sustainable.

**The question: Do we chase the new neighborhood or double down on the old identity?**

~~I think we need to go full rebrand. New name even?~~
Actually no, the name has value. "State Fair Cafe" is nostalgic in a good way.

## Ideas (ranked by how much I like them)

### MUST DO
1. ~~New logo - current one is embarrassingly dated~~ Actually Maggie loves it, tread carefully
2. Better social media - Instagram is essential, we have NOTHING
3. Online ordering - how do we not have this in 2024??
4. Menu refresh - at least SOME healthier options
5. Update the website - looks like 2008

### SHOULD DO
1. Interior refresh - not full renovation, but paint, lighting, small touches
2. Brunch cocktails - huge opportunity, license should be easy
3. Better coffee - partner with local roaster, charge more
4. Staff uniforms - current ones are depressing

### COULD DO
1. Rename to just "State Fair"? More modern
2. Full menu overhaul - "elevated comfort food"
3. Hire a real chef (no offense to Luis but...)
4. Add dinner service

### PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DO
1. Full rebrand with new name
2. Going "fast casual"
3. Major price increases

## The Luis Problem

Luis has been cooking here for 18 years. He knows every dish. He IS State Fair Cafe in many ways.

But he's resistant to change. Every new menu item I suggest, he pushes back. "That's not who we are." "The regulars won't like it." "We tried something like that in 2009."

I tried to introduce:
- Avocado toast (his response: "This isn't Brooklyn")
- Acai bowl (laughed at me)
- Egg white omelet (agreed but complained the whole time)

He's not wrong that the regulars don't want this stuff. But we CAN'T ONLY SERVE THE REGULARS FOREVER.

Actually... talked to Destiny (line cook) and she has great ideas. Culinary school trained. Maybe I can work with her instead?

**Update:** Destiny's "brioche French toast" tested well. Luis was annoyed but admitted it was good. Maybe there's a path here?

## Survey Results Summary (see full data in spreadsheet)

Confusing results. Basically:
- Regulars: DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING (but they're declining as % of customers)
- New visitors: Want changes (but they're not coming back anyway)

Is that the insight? New people TRY us once and don't return because...?
- Food is "fine but not exciting"
- Decor is "dated"
- No online ordering is frustrating
- Coffee is "just okay"

But regulars say:
- "Don't change the food"
- "Love the atmosphere"
- "Best coffee in Corktown" (contradicts new visitors??)
- "Feels like home"

WHO DO WE LISTEN TO?

## Competitor Notes (see full research files)

**Trendy spots (Folk, Dime Store):** Crushing it with 25-40 demo. Instagram-friendly. Wait times on weekends. Higher prices work because experience feels premium.

**Other classic diners (Honest John's, Elwood):** Similar struggles to us. Some adapting, some dying.

**Fast casual (First Watch, etc.):** Clean, efficient, predictable. Taking our lunch crowd.

The successful diners I've seen nationally either:
1. Went full retro-kitsch (lean INTO being old school, make it a thing)
2. Modernized completely (new everything)

Middle ground seems to fail. You're neither fish nor fowl.

**So which path for State Fair Cafe?**

## Financial Reality Check

Revenue down 18% over 3 years. That's bad.

But WHERE is it down?
- Weekday breakfast: down 25%
- Weekday lunch: down 30% (!!!)
- Weekend brunch: actually UP 5%

Hmm. Weekday lunch is getting killed by fast casual. Weekend brunch is our strength?

Maybe we don't need to change everything. Maybe we need to:
1. Accept that weekday lunch is a lost cause (or fight hard for it)
2. LEAN INTO weekend brunch
3. Find the weekday breakfast crowd

Actually I don't know. This is complicated.

## Conversation with Maggie (3 months ago)

She's conflicted. Wants more customers but doesn't want to "lose the soul" of the place.

Direct quotes:
- "I didn't spend 25 years building this so some consultant could turn it into an Applebee's"
- "But I also can't afford to keep losing money"
- "The new people in the neighborhood, they come once and never come back. Why?"
- "Derek, just tell me what to do. I'm tired."

I don't have an answer yet. That's the problem.

## Random Observations

- The jukebox is a hit with younger customers when they discover it. Maybe play that up?
- Patty (server, 22 years) has more customer loyalty than the restaurant itself. People come to see HER.
- The pie is genuinely excellent. Maggie's specialty. Undersold.
- Our coffee IS actually just okay. The regulars are used to it. New people notice.
- The parking situation sucks. Not much we can do.
- Location is great with the new traffic. We just don't capture it.

---

## What I Wish I Knew

- Why do new visitors not come back? Need better data.
- What would get them back WITHOUT alienating regulars?
- Is there a version of "modern" that feels authentic?
- How much would real renovations cost?
- What's Maggie's actual budget for changes?

---

## TODO Before I Leave

~~1. Finish competitor analysis~~
~~2. Complete survey analysis~~
3. Test 3 more menu items
4. Get quotes on interior refresh
5. Build out social media strategy
6. MAKE A DAMN RECOMMENDATION

*Last note: I don't think I'm the right person for this job. The answer is here somewhere but I can't see it. Sorry, Maggie.*
