## Recommendation

**KEEP ON MENU**

This item proves we can introduce new options that:
1. Appeal to younger customers
2. Feel elevated but not pretentious
3. Generate strong margins
4. Don't alienate regulars (they just stick with what they know)

Consider keeping BOTH versions on menu? "Classic French Toast" and "Brioche French Toast"?
