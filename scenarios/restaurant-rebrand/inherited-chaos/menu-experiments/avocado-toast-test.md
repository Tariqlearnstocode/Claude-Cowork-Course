## Staff Feedback

**Luis (head cook):** "No. Just no. This isn't who we are."

**Destiny (line cook):** "I think it makes sense to offer it, but it doesn't excite me either."

**Patty (server):** "Only the young people order it, and they don't seem that impressed."

## Analysis

The problem with avocado toast at State Fair Cafe:

1. **Doesn't feel authentic** - Customers who want avocado toast have better options nearby
2. **Doesn't leverage our strengths** - We're good at eggs, bacon, pancakes. Avocado toast doesn't play to that.
3. **Existing audience doesn't want it** - Regulars actively dislike seeing it on the menu
4. **Target audience isn't wowed** - New visitors order it but aren't impressed

This is a case of chasing a trend rather than evolving authentically.

## Comparison to Brioche French Toast

| Factor | Avocado Toast | Brioche French Toast |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Fits brand | Poor | Good |
| Leverages strengths | No | Yes (we do breakfast carbs well) |
| Regular reaction | Negative | Neutral/positive |
| New customer reaction | Meh | Positive |
| Staff buy-in | Low | High |

## Recommendation

**DISCONTINUE**

This was a failed experiment. Not because avocado toast is bad, but because it doesn't fit who we are.

Lesson learned: New menu items should be EXTENSIONS of our identity, not attempts to be someone else.
