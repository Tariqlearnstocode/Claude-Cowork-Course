# Analysis: The Untapped Pie Opportunity

## Background

Multiple data points suggest Maggie's pie is significantly undersold and undermarketed:

**Survey mentions:**
- "The pie! Didn't expect much but the pie was incredible. Highlight that more!"
- "The pie is genuinely excellent. Maggie's specialty. Undersold."
- "Best pie I've had outside of my grandmother's kitchen"

**Staff observations:**
- Patty: "People are always surprised by how good the pie is. Like they didn't expect it from a diner."
- Luis: "Maggie's been making those pies for 25 years. It's the real thing. No shortcuts."

**My observations:**
- The pie is genuinely exceptional - house-made, from scratch, seasonal flavors
- It's buried at the bottom of the menu as an afterthought
- No photos of pie anywhere (menu, social media, website)
- Priced at $5.99/slice - arguably too cheap for the quality

## Current State

| Metric | Current |
|--------|---------|
| Price per slice | $5.99 |
| Average slices sold/day | 12 |
| Daily pie revenue | $71.88 |
| Weekly pie revenue | $503 |
| Cost per slice (estimated) | $1.80 |
| Weekly pie profit | $377 |

**Pie varieties (rotating):**
- Apple (classic, always available)
- Cherry
- Blueberry (summer)
- Pecan (fall/winter)
- Pumpkin (seasonal)
- Coconut cream
- Chocolate cream
- Lemon meringue

All made by Maggie herself. She comes in early specifically to bake.

## The Opportunity

Pie could be a signature differentiator:
- It's authentic (Maggie's personal recipes, 25 years of perfecting)
- It's ownable (no one else in Corktown has house-made pie like this)
- It's photogenic (good for social media)
- It's nostalgic (fits our brand perfectly)
- It's shareable (people post pie photos)

## Proposed Initiatives

### 1. Rename and reposition
- Current: "Desserts" section with "Pie of the day - $5.99"
- Proposed: "Maggie's Famous Pies" with its own menu section and story

### 2. Price increase
- Current: $5.99
- Proposed: $7.99 (still a value for house-made pie)
- Rationale: Quality justifies premium; current price undervalues the product

### 3. Add pie flight
- "Maggie's Pie Sampler" - three small slices, $9.99
- Encourages trial, great for sharing/photos

### 4. Whole pie sales
- Offer whole pies for takeaway
- Price: $32-38 depending on variety
- Holiday pre-orders (Thanksgiving, Christmas)
- Birthday/special occasion option

### 5. Marketing push
- Professional pie photos for Instagram
- "Behind the scenes" content of Maggie baking
- "Pie of the week" email/social media
- Partner with local media for feature story

### 6. Physical presence
- Pie display case near entrance (currently hidden in back)
- Visible pie cutting/serving
- Menu table tents featuring pie

## Financial Projection

**Conservative scenario (price increase only):**
- New price: $7.99/slice
- Same volume: 12 slices/day
- New daily revenue: $95.88
- New weekly revenue: $671
- Improvement: +$168/week = +$8,736/year

**Moderate scenario (price + 25% volume increase):**
- New price: $7.99/slice
- New volume: 15 slices/day
- New daily revenue: $119.85
- New weekly revenue: $839
- Improvement: +$336/week = +$17,472/year

**Aggressive scenario (full program):**
- Includes whole pie sales, pie flights, events
- Estimated additional revenue: $400-600/week
- Annual improvement: $25,000-35,000

## Why This Matters Strategically

Pie is the perfect "authentic enhancement" for State Fair Cafe:
- It's already who we are (just undersold)
- It appeals to ALL demographics (regulars love it, new visitors are surprised by it)
- It reinforces our identity rather than changing it
- It's a genuine competitive advantage (hard to replicate)
- It tells a story (Maggie, 25 years, family recipes)

This is NOT chasing a trend. This is recognizing what we already have and amplifying it.

## Recommendation

**HIGH PRIORITY - IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY**

This should be Phase 1 of any strategy. Low cost, low risk, high potential upside. And it's completely on-brand.

The pie isn't a problem we need to fix. It's a strength we need to leverage.

## Questions to Resolve

1. Can Maggie increase pie production? Or do we need to scale carefully?
2. What's the cost of a proper pie display case? (~$1,500-3,000)
3. Is Maggie comfortable being featured in marketing?
4. Whole pie pricing - need to verify COGS per whole pie
