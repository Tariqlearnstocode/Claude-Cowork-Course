# Proposal: Coffee Program Upgrade

*Draft - not yet implemented*

## The Problem

Coffee is mentioned repeatedly in customer feedback as a weak point:
- Regulars: "Best coffee in Corktown" (they're being loyal, not accurate)
- New visitors: "Coffee is just okay" / "Coffee was weak" / "Expected better coffee"

Currently we use:
- **Brand:** Sysco food service coffee (generic)
- **Cost:** $0.18/cup
- **Price:** $3.49 (bottomless refills)
- **Margin:** Basically infinite (coffee is a profit center)

The problem: Our coffee is fine but forgettable. In a neighborhood with Astro Coffee (excellent), Great Lakes Coffee (excellent), and multiple other specialty options, "fine" doesn't cut it anymore.

## The Opportunity

Coffee is:
- First impression for many customers
- Something people consume daily (habit-forming)
- An easy upgrade that doesn't threaten brand identity
- A potential talking point ("We roast with [local partner]")

## Proposed Solution

Partner with a local Detroit roaster for house blend.

**Top candidates researched:**

| Roaster | Cost/lb | Min Order | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Anthology Coffee | $12.50 | 20 lbs/week | Hip, might clash with our vibe |
| Germack Coffee | $10.00 | 15 lbs/week | Detroit institution, family-owned since 1924 |
| Populace Coffee | $14.00 | 25 lbs/week | Excellent quality, higher cost |
| Detroit Bold | $11.00 | 10 lbs/week | Flexible terms, decent quality |

**My recommendation: Germack Coffee**

Reasons:
1. Detroit institution (like us) - authentic partnership story
2. Family-owned for 100 years - values alignment
3. Reasonable pricing
4. They'd likely co-brand with us ("State Fair Cafe blend")
5. Not too "hipster" - won't alienate regulars

## Financial Impact

**Current:**
- Cost: ~$0.18/cup
- Price: $3.49
- Cups sold/week: ~800
- Weekly coffee revenue: $2,792
- Weekly coffee cost: $144
- Weekly coffee profit: $2,648

**Proposed:**
- Cost: ~$0.35/cup (with Germack)
- Price: $3.99 (modest increase)
- Assumed cups sold/week: 850 (+6% from better reputation)
- Weekly coffee revenue: $3,392
- Weekly coffee cost: $298
- Weekly coffee profit: $3,094

**Net improvement: +$446/week = +$23,192/year**

*Assumptions may be optimistic but directionally correct*

## Implementation Considerations

- Need new coffee equipment? Current machines are old but functional
- Staff training on new brewing process
- Signage highlighting partnership
- Gradual transition or hard cutover?

## Risks

1. Regulars might not like the new taste (mitigate: "We've upgraded our coffee!")
2. Price increase could cause friction (mitigate: small increase, better product)
3. Partnership logistics (mitigate: start with trial period)

## Recommendation

**PURSUE - LOW RISK, HIGH REWARD**

This is exactly the kind of change State Fair Cafe should make:
- Enhances quality without changing identity
- Supports local business (great story)
- Addresses real customer complaint
- Financially positive
- Doesn't require major renovation or rebranding

## Next Steps (if approved)

1. Contact Germack for partnership discussion
2. Schedule tasting/trial
3. Train staff
4. Update menu/signage
5. Soft launch, gather feedback
6. Full implementation
