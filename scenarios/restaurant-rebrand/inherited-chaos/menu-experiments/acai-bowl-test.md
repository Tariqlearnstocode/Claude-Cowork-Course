## Customer Feedback (sampled)

- "I wouldn't order this here. Go somewhere that specializes in it." - Woman, ~28

- "Is this a joke?" - Regular, ~70

## Staff Feedback

**Luis (head cook):** "I'm not making smoothie bowls. This is a diner."

**Destiny (line cook):** "I didn't mind making it but nobody ordered it. It was embarrassing sitting on the menu."

**Patty (server):** "I had to explain what it was to most customers. They weren't interested."

**Michelle (server):** "The one guy who ordered it took a photo, ate half, and left. Said it was 'fine but weird to eat here.'"

## Analysis

Complete failure. This was a mistake from the start.

**What went wrong:**
1. Zero brand fit - Acai bowls are associated with juice bars, health food spots, beachy California vibes. Not Detroit diners.
2. No audience - Neither regulars nor new visitors wanted this here
3. Operational complexity - Required new equipment, new prep process, ingredients we don't normally stock
4. Perception damage - Made us look like we didn't know who we were

**The real problem:** I (Derek) pushed this despite everyone telling me it was a bad idea. I wanted to prove we could be "anything." We can't. And that's okay.

## Recommendation

**DISCONTINUE IMMEDIATELY**

Remove from menu. Consider selling the blender. Chalk this up as a lesson in brand authenticity.

Not every trendy item belongs on every menu. State Fair Cafe should have never offered acai bowls. The fact that we tried makes us look desperate.
