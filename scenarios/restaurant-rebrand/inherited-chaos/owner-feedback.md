**Subject:** Initial thoughts on modernization

Hi Maggie,

Great meeting yesterday. I'm excited to dig into this project.

Based on our conversation, I'm thinking we pursue a full rebrand - new visual identity, refreshed menu, updated interior. The goal would be to attract the new Corktown demographic while keeping what makes State Fair Cafe special.

I'll start with customer research and competitor analysis. Should have preliminary findings in 2-3 weeks.

Quick question: What's your budget ceiling for physical renovations? Ballpark is fine.

Best,
Derek

Derek,

Excited to have you on board too!

Full rebrand sounds big. Let's see what the research says first? I want to be open-minded but I also don't want to lose what we've built. You know?

Budget: honestly not sure. Depends on what makes sense. If you told me $20k would solve our problems I'd find it. If you told me $200k... I'd need to think hard.

Can we start with small changes and see what works?

Maggie,

Totally understand. Let's let the data guide us.

I'll focus first on understanding WHY revenue is declining and WHAT customers (current and potential) actually want. Then we can discuss solutions that fit your comfort level and budget.

One thing I do want to flag early: "small changes" might not be enough. The restaurant industry is brutal right now and half-measures often fail. But let's see what the research says.

Talk soon,
Derek

**Subject:** Research update - interesting findings

Maggie,

Quick update on where I am.

Customer surveys are showing a clear split:
- Regulars (55+): Love everything, hate change
- New visitors (25-40): Find us "dated" and "boring"

This is the classic innovator's dilemma. Do we serve our current customers or chase future ones?

The new Corktown residents COULD be our customers - they value authenticity, they have disposable income, they eat out frequently. But right now they try us once and don't come back.

I think we need to get more aggressive about changes. Not abandon our identity, but evolve it.

Can we meet this week to discuss?

Derek

Derek,

This worries me.

The regulars are why we've survived 25 years. I know them. I love them. They're family.

The young people who come once and leave... are they even our customers? Maybe State Fair Cafe isn't FOR them. Is that okay?

I don't know. I'm confused.

Yes, let's meet. Thursday at 3?

Thursday works.

I hear your concern. But I have to be honest: the regulars alone can't sustain the business. The math doesn't work. We need new customers.

That doesn't mean abandoning who we are. It means figuring out how to be ourselves in a way that appeals to more people.

See you Thursday.

**Subject:** After our meeting

Derek,

I've been thinking about what you said.

You're right that we need to change. But I can't stop thinking about what happens if we change too much and lose the regulars AND fail to get the new people. Then we have nothing.

What if we tried some small things first? Better photos for Instagram, maybe that online ordering thing, a few new menu items? See how it goes?

I know you want to go bigger. I'm just scared.

Maggie,

I understand the fear. Change is hard.

Let's try it your way. I'll focus on:
1. Social media presence (I'll create an Instagram strategy)
2. Researching online ordering options
3. Testing a few new menu items
4. Gathering more customer feedback

We can treat this as Phase 1. Small changes, measure results, then decide on Phase 2.

But I want you to stay open to bigger changes if the data supports it. Deal?

Deal. Thank you for being patient with me.

One more thing: please talk to Luis before changing anything on the menu. He's been with me for 18 years. His buy-in matters.

**Subject:** Menu testing results

Maggie,

Tested three new items over the past two weeks:
1. Brioche French Toast - SUCCESSFUL. Customers loved it. Even Luis admitted it was good.
2. Avocado Toast - Mixed results. Regulars ignored it, new visitors ordered it but weren't wowed.
3. Acai Bowl - Failure. Nobody ordered it. Felt out of place.

This is actually good data. It tells us:
- We CAN add new items that work
- But they need to feel like natural extensions of who we are
- Chasing trends just to chase trends doesn't work here

What do you think?

This makes me happy, Derek!

The brioche French toast sounds like something we should keep. Destiny made it, right? She's talented.

Can we keep going this direction? Small, thoughtful updates that don't feel forced?

**Subject:** Competitor research complete

Maggie,

Finished the competitor analysis. Sending full files separately but here's the summary:

The successful "classic" restaurants I studied did one of two things:
1. Full modernization (new everything, basically a new restaurant)
2. Doubled down on authenticity (leaned INTO being old school)

The ones that tried to split the difference mostly struggled.

I'm starting to think Option 2 might be right for us. What if State Fair Cafe doesn't need to become modern - what if it needs to become MORE itself?

Still thinking this through. More soon.

"Become more itself" - I like that. What does it mean practically?

**Subject:** Re: Competitor research complete

I'm not 100% sure yet. But something like:

- Keep the identity, the food, the soul
- But FIX the things that frustrate people (no online ordering, bad website, payment options)
- HIGHLIGHT what's special (the history, the pies, the community feel)
- Make small updates that enhance rather than replace (better lighting, fresh paint, not a full renovation)

The goal would be: "Classic Detroit diner, now with modern conveniences"

Instead of: "Classic Detroit diner trying to be trendy"

Does this resonate?

YES! This is what I've been trying to say!

Can you put together a full plan with this approach? Budget estimates too?

I feel like we're finally getting somewhere.

Maggie,

I'm sorry to do this but I need to resign, effective immediately. Personal reasons I can't get into.

I've left all my research files in the Google Drive folder. I hope they're useful to whoever comes next.

I apologize for leaving you in this position. State Fair Cafe is a special place. The answer is in there somewhere - I just couldn't quite find it.

Best of luck,
Derek

Thank you for your work. I'll figure it out.

Take care of yourself.
