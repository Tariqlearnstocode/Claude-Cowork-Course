## What's Working

### Top performing content:

**1. History/nostalgia posts**
- The opening day photo (67 likes, 12 comments) dramatically outperformed everything else
- Comments: "This is so cool!" / "Love seeing old Detroit" / "My parents used to go here!"
- **Insight:** People respond to our STORY, not just our food

**2. Personality posts**
- Luis in the kitchen performed well (41 likes, 6 comments)
- Comments: "Love seeing the real people!" / "Legend"
- **Insight:** People want to connect with HUMANS, not just a brand

**3. Unique features**
- Jukebox post (61 likes, 9 comments) - people loved the vintage feel
- Comments: "Wait you have a real jukebox??" / "This is amazing" / "Taking my dad here"
- **Insight:** Our "dated" features are actually differentiators

**4. Successful new items**
- Brioche French toast (52 likes, 7 comments)
- Shows we can generate excitement for new things that fit our brand

---

## What's Not Working

### Poor performers:

**1. Generic food shots**
- Standard breakfast plates, overhead coffee shots - boring
- Looks like every other restaurant
- Doesn't tell a story or show personality

**2. Trend-chasing**
- The acai bowl post bombed (8 likes)
- Felt inauthentic, comments reflected it

**3. Generic content**
- Quote posts, "we're open" posts - zero engagement
- Adds nothing, wastes posting opportunity

**4. Inconsistent posting**
- Gaps of 5-7 days between posts
- Algorithm punishes inconsistency

## Competitor Comparison

### Folk Detroit (@folkdetroit)
- Followers: 28.4K
- Aesthetic: Highly curated, professional photography
- Content: Food porn, seasonal ingredients, farm partners
- Engagement: 400-800 likes/post

### Dime Store (@dikiestoredetroit)
- Followers: 15.2K
- Aesthetic: Fun, colorful, branded
- Content: Menu items, staff features, Detroit pride
- Engagement: 200-400 likes/post

### Honest John's (@honestjohnsdetroit)
- Followers: 4.8K
- Aesthetic: Gritty, authentic, unpolished
- Content: Real moments, regulars, dive bar vibes
- Engagement: 150-300 likes/post

**Observation:** We don't need to be Folk (polished). We could be more like Honest John's (authentic). Our audience would appreciate real over curated.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Content pillars (what to post):

**1. Heritage Stories (30%)**
- Old photos
- Maggie's history
- Detroit connection
- Regulars and their stories (with permission)
- "25 years in Corktown" narrative

**2. People & Personality (30%)**
- Staff features
- Regular customers
- Behind the scenes
- Luis cooking
- Patty's wisdom
- Real moments, not staged

**3. Food & Menu (25%)**
- BUT: Focus on what makes us different
- Maggie's pies (hero content)
- The classics (State Fair Special)
- New items that fit our brand
- Process shots (Maggie baking, Luis griddling)

**4. Atmosphere & Details (15%)**
- The jukebox
- The counter
- The old photos on walls
- The vibe
- The neighborhood

### What to STOP doing:
- Generic food shots
- Quote posts
- "We're open" posts
- Chasing trends (no more acai)
- Trying to look like trendy spots

### Posting strategy:
- Minimum 4x/week (consistency)
- Best times: 7-9am, 11am-1pm, 6-8pm
- Use Stories for daily casual content
- Reels potential for jukebox, cooking, atmosphere

## The Opportunity

We're sitting on a goldmine of authentic content:
- 25 years of history
- Staff with decades of tenure
- Real regulars with stories
- Vintage features (jukebox, counter, decor)
- Genuine hospitality
- House-made pies

Most restaurants would KILL for this authenticity. They're faking it. We have it naturally.

The Instagram strategy shouldn't be "look trendy." It should be "show who we really are - because who we really are is actually really cool."

---

## Next Steps (if continuing)

1. Photo/video shoot of key content:
   - Maggie baking pies
   - Luis cooking classics
   - Patty serving regulars
   - The jukebox in action
   - Morning counter scene

2. Gather historical content:
   - Old photos from Maggie
   - Opening day materials
   - Newspaper clippings
   - Customer stories

3. Establish posting calendar:
   - 4-5x/week minimum
   - Mix of content types
   - Consistent aesthetic (warm, authentic, not over-produced)

4. Consider paid promotion:
   - Small budget ($200-300/month)
   - Target Corktown residents, Detroit foodies
   - Boost best-performing organic content
