## Current Customer Demographics

### Age Distribution (estimated from observation + payment data)

| Age Range | % of Customers | Trend vs. 2022 |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| 18-24 | 5% | Stable |
| 25-34 | 12% | Down from 18% |
| 35-44 | 18% | Stable |
| 45-54 | 20% | Stable |
| 55-64 | 22% | Up from 18% |
| 65+ | 23% | Up from 19% |

**Key insight:** Our customer base is aging. 55+ now represents 45% of customers (was 37% in 2022). Meanwhile, the 25-34 demographic (largest in Corktown) is declining as percentage of our customers.

## Customer Segmentation Analysis

### Segment: Regulars (Daily/Weekly visitors)
- **Size:** ~120 individuals
- **Visit frequency:** 2-5x per week
- **Avg check:** $12.80
- **Demographics:** 55+, 65% male
- **Revenue contribution:** ~40%
- **Behavior:** Same seat, same order, same time
- **Trend:** Stable but aging

### Segment: Weekend Brunch Families
- **Size:** ~200 households
- **Visit frequency:** 2-4x per month
- **Avg check:** $48 (family)
- **Demographics:** 35-50, families with kids
- **Revenue contribution:** ~25%
- **Behavior:** Saturday/Sunday 9-11am
- **Trend:** Stable to growing

### Segment: Occasional Visitors
- **Size:** ~300 individuals
- **Visit frequency:** Monthly or less
- **Avg check:** $15.20
- **Demographics:** Mixed
- **Revenue contribution:** ~20%
- **Behavior:** Sporadic, often special occasions
- **Trend:** Declining

### Segment: One-Time Visitors
- **Size:** Unknown (est. 500+/year)
- **Visit frequency:** Once and done
- **Avg check:** $14.00
- **Demographics:** Younger, 25-40
- **Revenue contribution:** ~15%
- **Behavior:** Try once, don't return
- **Trend:** Stable volume but low conversion

---

## The "One and Done" Problem

Estimated new visitor flow:
- **New visitors per month:** ~45-50
- **Return rate:** ~18%
- **Lost potential customers per month:** ~37-40
- **Lost potential customers per year:** ~450

If we could improve return rate from 18% to 35%:
- Additional returning customers: ~75/year
- At average frequency of 1x/month = 900 additional visits
- At $14.50 avg check = **$13,050 additional annual revenue**

Improving new visitor experience is a significant opportunity.

## Geographic Analysis (payment data zip codes)

| Zip Code | % of Customers | Area |
|----------|---------------|------|
| 48216 | 42% | Corktown (local) |
| 48226 | 15% | Downtown |
| 48201 | 12% | Midtown |
| 48208 | 8% | Near west side |
| Other 482xx | 18% | Metro Detroit |
| Outside 482 | 5% | Visitors/tourists |

**Insight:** We're a neighborhood restaurant. 42% of customers are Corktown locals. Another 35% come from adjacent neighborhoods. Very few people travel far for us.

**But:** Corktown population is ~8,000. If 42% of our customers come from there, and we're seeing ~800 covers/week... we're capturing a meaningful share. But population is changing (younger, higher income) and we're not capturing the NEW residents.

## Corktown New Resident Opportunity

**Corktown population change (2019-2024):**
- Net new residents: ~2,200
- Demographics: 70% age 25-40, median income $78k
- Lifestyle: Professionals, food-motivated, social media active

**Current capture rate of new residents:** Estimated <15%

**Why?**
- They don't know about us (visibility)
- They try us once and don't return (experience gap)
- We don't match their expectations (perception)
- We're hard to access (no online ordering, weak web presence)

**Opportunity:** 2,200 new residents x 15% additional capture = 330 new potential regulars. At even 1x/month x $14.50 = $57,420 additional annual revenue.

## Traffic Source Analysis

How do customers find us?

| Source | % of New Customers | Trend |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Walk-by/local | 35% | Stable |
| Word of mouth | 28% | Declining |
| Google Search | 18% | Growing |
| Yelp | 8% | Declining |
| Instagram | 4% | New/growing |
| Other | 7% | Mixed |

**Key insight:** Google is increasingly important. Our weak Google presence (outdated info, few photos, unanswered questions) is hurting us.

## Implications

### What the data tells us:

1. **Our core is solid but aging.** Regulars love us but they're getting older. We need to add younger customers without losing the old.

2. **Weekend brunch is a strength.** Don't mess with it. Maybe build on it.

3. **Weekday decline is structural.** Work-from-home, fast casual competition. Hard to reverse fully.

4. **New visitors don't convert.** This is THE opportunity. Something about their experience doesn't hook them.

5. **Corktown new residents are untapped.** They're here, they have money, they eat out. We're not capturing them.

6. **Digital presence matters more than ever.** Google search is growing as discovery source. We're not optimized for it.

### Strategic implications:

- Focus on converting first-time visitors to repeat customers
- Capture Corktown new residents through better visibility and experience
- Protect weekend brunch as core strength
- Accept some weekday decline but stabilize
- Invest in digital presence (website, Google, Instagram)

## Data Gaps & Notes

- POS data is limited (old system)
- Demographic estimates are partly observational (not scientific)
- Competitor foot traffic data would be useful but unavailable
- Would benefit from formal customer survey beyond the one Derek conducted
