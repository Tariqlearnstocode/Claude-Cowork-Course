## Recent Review Highlights (Last 6 months)

### 5-Star Reviews

**"Detroit institution" - Mark T. (Local Guide, 4 months ago)**
> "Been eating at State Fair Cafe for over a decade. Maggie built something special here. The food is consistent, the prices are fair, and Patty is a treasure. If you want a trendy Instagram brunch, go somewhere else. If you want a real breakfast with real people, come here."

**"Hidden gem" - Samantha L. (3 months ago)**
> "My boyfriend grew up coming here with his dad. He took me for the first time last weekend. I honestly didn't expect much but the pie blew my mind. Homemade apple pie that tastes like my grandmother's. We'll be back."

**"The real Corktown" - David R. (2 months ago)**
> "With all the gentrification happening, places like State Fair Cafe are rare. Don't let them disappear. Support local diners that have been here forever, not just the flashy new spots."

**"Patty is family" - Janet M. (5 months ago)**
> "I've been coming here since my kids were babies. They're in college now. Patty still asks about them. Where else do you get that? The food is great but it's the people that keep me coming back."

### 3-Star Reviews

**"It's fine" - Alex K. (2 months ago)**
> "Food was okay, nothing special. Decor is very dated. Service was friendly. Wouldn't go out of my way but it's an acceptable option if you're in the area."

**"Decent diner" - Rebecca N. (4 months ago)**
> "Standard diner fare at standard diner prices. Not sure what the fuss is about honestly. Maybe you have to be a regular to get it?"

**"Needs updating" - Chris D. (3 months ago)**
> "Tried to order online - no option. Tried to look at menu online - website barely works. Had to call like it's 1995. Food was fine once I got there but the experience of finding/ordering was frustrating."

### 1-Star Reviews

**"Disappointing" - Taylor H. (5 months ago)**
> "Based on reviews expected something special. It's just an old diner with old food. Eggs were overcooked, coffee was weak, and the atmosphere was depressing. Don't believe the hype."

**"Not for me" - Morgan P. (1 month ago)**
> "Walked in, felt like I'd interrupted someone's family reunion. Everyone knew everyone. Felt weird being there. Food was meh. Left feeling like this place isn't for outsiders."

## The Insight

The Morgan P. review is worth reading again:

> "Walked in, felt like I'd interrupted someone's family reunion. Everyone knew everyone. Felt weird being there."

This person experienced our greatest strength - community - as a weakness. They felt excluded.

How do we make new visitors feel welcome without losing the family feel that regulars love?

Some ideas:
- Train staff to engage first-timers: "First time here? Let me tell you about the place..."
- Menu cards with history/story
- Signage welcoming newcomers: "New friends welcome since 1999"
- Regulars setting the tone of inclusion (Patty does this naturally)
