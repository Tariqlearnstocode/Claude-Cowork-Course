## Our Voice in Three Words

**Capable. Approachable. Detroit-Proud.**

We're tech people who talk like humans. We know our stuff, but we don't talk down to anyone. We're from Detroit—we understand hard work, resilience, and getting things done without a lot of flash.

---

## Tone Principles

### 1. Smart, Not Smug
We're experts, but we're not here to make anyone feel dumb. Explain things clearly. Avoid jargon unless our audience uses it too.

**Yes:** "BookIt syncs with your Google Calendar automatically—no double-booking, no stress."

**No:** "Our proprietary synchronization engine leverages API integration to eliminate scheduling conflicts."

### 2. Confident, Not Salesy
We believe in what we build. We don't need to oversell it. State what we do, show the value, move on.

**Yes:** "Manage your whole week in one place."

**No:** "Revolutionary! Game-changing! The ULTIMATE scheduling solution!!!"

### 3. Friendly, Not Cutesy
We're warm and human, but we're not a meme account. We can be funny when it fits. We don't force it.

**Yes:** "Running a business is hard. Scheduling shouldn't be."

**No:** "Ugh, scheduling amirite? It's giving chaos! Let us fix that bestie!"

### 4. Local Pride, Universal Appeal
Detroit is part of our identity. We reference it when it feels natural, but we're building for everyone.

**Yes:** "Built in Detroit for businesses everywhere."

**No:** "We're a DETROIT company and everything we do is about DETROIT."

## Audience Assumptions

Our customers are:
- Busy (don't waste their time)
- Practical (show value fast)
- Not necessarily "tech people" (but not intimidated by apps)
- Running real businesses (respect their expertise in their field)

We write for the hair salon owner checking her phone between clients, the mechanic who hates paperwork, the consultant juggling 15 clients.

---

## Words We Use

- Appointments, bookings (not "engagements" or "sessions")
- Customers, clients (depending on their industry)
- Schedule, calendar (not "temporal management interface")
- Simple, easy, fast (prove it, don't just claim it)
- Your business (not "your enterprise" unless actually enterprise)

## Words We Avoid

- Synergy, leverage, optimize (corporate buzzwords)
- Revolutionary, game-changing, best-in-class (empty superlatives)
- Disrupting (we're solving problems, not "disrupting industries")
- AI-powered (unless it actually is and it matters to the feature)

---

## Sample Copy

**Homepage headline:**
"Your schedule, handled."

**Feature description:**
"Send automatic reminders so clients actually show up. Customize the timing and message for each service you offer."

**Error message:**
"Something went wrong on our end. We're looking into it. Try again in a few minutes, or contact support@motorcityapps.com if it keeps happening."

**Email subject line:**
"Your BookIt account is ready"
(Not: "Welcome to the BookIt family!" or "Your scheduling journey begins NOW")

---

## Visual Identity Notes

*(For reference—design files are with Jerome)*

- **Primary color:** Deep blue (#1E3A5F) - professional, trustworthy
- **Accent color:** Motor City orange (#D94E1F) - energy, warmth
- **Typography:** Inter for UI, Source Serif for marketing headlines
- **Photography style:** Real people, real businesses, candid moments

## Questions?

This is a living document. If something feels off-brand or you're not sure how to phrase something, ask me (Aaliyah). I'd rather help than have us sound inconsistent.

*Note: These guidelines were written before the BookIt launch. I've been meaning to revisit them based on what we learned, but... well, you know how that's been going. —A*
