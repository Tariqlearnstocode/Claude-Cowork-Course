# Product Launch Recovery: BookIt by MotorCity Apps

## Your Mission

You've been brought in as a consultant to rescue a failed product launch. MotorCity Apps, a small software company in Detroit, launched their scheduling app "BookIt" three months ago. It flopped. Hard.

The previous project manager, Marcus Chen, left the company two weeks ago. He didn't leave much behind—just scattered files, half-finished documents, and a lot of unanswered questions.

Your job: untangle this mess, figure out what went wrong, and create a relaunch plan.

## Company Background

**MotorCity Apps** was founded in 2019 by two former automotive software engineers, Dana Kowalski (CEO) and Jerome Washington (CTO). They started by building internal tools for dealerships, then pivoted to consumer software in 2022.

- **Location:** Detroit, Michigan (Corktown neighborhood)
- **Team Size:** 14 employees (was 16 before recent departures)
- **Funding:** $1.2M seed round (2020), bootstrapped since
- **Runway:** Approximately 8 months at current burn rate

The company culture is scrappy and fast-moving. They ship quickly—sometimes too quickly.

## The Product: BookIt

BookIt is a scheduling and appointment management app designed to help small businesses manage bookings. Think: hair salons, auto shops, consultants, fitness trainers.

**Launch Date:** October 15, 2024
**Current Status:** ~340 active users (down from 1,200 at peak)
**Monthly Revenue:** $2,100 MRR (target was $15,000 by now)

The app exists. It works (mostly). But almost nobody is using it.

## What You Have to Work With

In the `inherited-chaos/` folder, you'll find:

- **pm-handoff-notes.md** - Marcus's rushed notes before he left
- **feature-requests.csv** - A spreadsheet of feature requests from... everyone
- **customer-complaints/** - Support tickets, reviews, and angry emails
- **competitor-analysis/** - Research on Calendly, Acuity, and others
- **launch-materials/** - Half-finished marketing assets
- **meeting-notes/** - Summaries from various planning meetings

Fair warning: these files are messy. Some contradict each other. Some are incomplete. Some might be wrong. That's the reality you're walking into.

## Key People You'll Encounter (in the files)

- **Dana Kowalski** - CEO. Big vision, sometimes unrealistic timelines.
- **Jerome Washington** - CTO. Technically brilliant, skeptical of marketing.
- **Marcus Chen** - Former PM (departed). Left the mess you're inheriting.
- **Aaliyah Foster** - Head of Marketing. Understaffed and overwhelmed.
- **Pete Novak** - Lead Developer. Burned out from constant pivots.
- **Carmen Reyes** - Customer Support (solo). Has heard every complaint.

## Your Deliverable

After analyzing everything, you need to create a relaunch plan that addresses:

1. **Root Cause Analysis** - What actually went wrong?
2. **Product Focus** - What should BookIt actually be?
3. **Target Market** - Who should they be selling to?
4. **Feature Prioritization** - What to fix, what to cut, what to add?
5. **Go-to-Market Strategy** - How to relaunch successfully?

## A Note on the Chaos

The files you're about to dig through are frustrating by design. Real inherited projects are messy. People contradict each other. Documentation is incomplete. The truth is scattered across multiple sources.

Your job is to synthesize, not just summarize. Look for patterns. Notice what's missing. Read between the lines.

Good luck. MotorCity Apps is counting on you.
