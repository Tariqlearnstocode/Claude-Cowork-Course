4. Go-to-market strategy

---

## 1. Launch Date

**Dana:** We need to launch October 15th. I have a podcast interview with Detroit Tech Weekly on October 18th—this is a huge opportunity and I want to talk about a live product.

**Marcus:** That's 60 days away. I'm concerned we won't be ready. The mobile app still has performance issues, and onboarding needs work.

**Jerome:** The core product is solid. We can fix mobile in a patch after launch.

**Marcus:** Launching with known performance issues seems risky.

**Dana:** We've been in development for 18 months. At some point we have to ship. October 15th is the date.

**DECISION:** Launch date confirmed: October 15, 2024

*[Marcus's note: I disagreed but was overruled.]*

## 2. Target Market

**Dana:** I've been thinking about this a lot. I think we should go after mid-market and enterprise. That's where the real revenue is.

**Aaliyah:** Our beta users are mostly solopreneurs and tiny businesses. Salons, consultants, fitness trainers. They love the product.

**Dana:** But they're paying $12-29/month. Enterprise deals are $10K+ annually.

**Marcus:** We don't have enterprise features. No real admin tools, no compliance, no SLA.

**Jerome:** I've been building SSO. We could add API access in a few weeks. That's enterprise-ready.

**Aaliyah:** But that's not what our actual users want. They want buffer time between appointments. They want simpler onboarding.

**Dana:** We can do both. The product should work for everyone—solo to enterprise.

**Marcus:** That's the Acuity strategy. They've been at it for 18 years and have a huge head start.

**Dana:** Then we need to catch up. Jerome, can you prioritize SSO and API for launch?

**Jerome:** Already on it.

**DECISION:** Target market = "businesses of all sizes" with emphasis on growth toward enterprise

*[Marcus's note: This is trying to be everything to everyone. I think it's a mistake.]*

## 3. Feature Prioritization

**Discussion of what to include in launch:**

**Must have (Jerome's list):**
- Online booking ✓
- Calendar sync ✓
- Reminders ✓
- Payment integration ✓
- Team scheduling ✓
- Mobile apps ✓
- SSO (enterprise) - IN PROGRESS
- API access (enterprise) - IN PROGRESS

**Should have (Marcus's list):**
- Improved onboarding
- Mobile performance fixes
- Buffer time between appointments
- Intake forms

**Dana's additions:**
- Enterprise tier pricing
- Dedicated enterprise support email
- Custom branding removal option

**Aaliyah's requests:**
- Industry-specific templates
- Better testimonials/social proof
- Demo video

**DECISIONS:**
- SSO and API: APPROVED for launch (Jerome to complete)
- Enterprise tier: APPROVED (Dana to finalize pricing)
- Buffer time: DEPRIORITIZED to post-launch
- Onboarding improvements: IN PROGRESS (may not finish)
- Mobile performance: IN PROGRESS (patch after launch)
- Industry templates: DEPRIORITIZED

*[Marcus's note: We're prioritizing enterprise features over basic features that our actual users want. I raised this concern. I was told enterprise is the priority.]*

## 4. Go-to-Market Strategy

**Aaliyah:** I've drafted a launch plan. Key elements:
- Email to beta users and waitlist
- Social media campaign
- Press release to local media
- Product Hunt launch (Marcus suggests waiting)
- Content marketing (blog posts, tutorials)

**Dana:** What about enterprise outreach? I have contacts at some Detroit-area companies.

**Aaliyah:** We could do direct outreach, but enterprise sales cycles are long. We won't close deals at launch.

**Dana:** But we should start the conversations. Jerome, can you make a one-pager about enterprise features?

**Jerome:** Sure.

**Marcus:** I'm worried we're spreading too thin. We have one marketer and we're trying to do SMB marketing AND enterprise sales simultaneously.

**Dana:** We'll figure it out. This is a startup—everyone wears multiple hats.

**DECISIONS:**
- Launch plan approved
- Enterprise outreach to be added
- Product Hunt: TBD (Marcus hesitant, Dana wants to do it)

## My Observations (Marcus, not shared with group)

This meeting concerned me. Here's what I noticed:

1. **Launch date is driven by a podcast interview, not product readiness.** That's backwards.

2. **We're chasing enterprise without the foundation.** SSO and an API don't make us enterprise-ready. We're missing admin tools, compliance, and most importantly, a sales team.

3. **We're ignoring our actual users.** Aaliyah and I both mentioned that beta users want buffer time, simpler onboarding, better mobile. We got overruled in favor of enterprise features.

4. **Dana and Jerome are aligned. Aaliyah and I are concerned but outvoted.** This feels like a decision already made before the meeting.

5. **We're trying to do too much with too little.** 14 people, one marketer, no sales team, no dedicated support. And we're targeting "everyone."

I'm documenting this because I think we're making a mistake and I want it on record.
