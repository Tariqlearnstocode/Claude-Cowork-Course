## What Went Well

**Dana:** We launched. That's something. A lot of companies never ship.

**Aaliyah:** Email campaign performed okay. 42% open rate on launch announcement.

**Jerome:** Core booking functionality is stable. No major outages.

**Pete:** We fixed the calendar sync bug within 48 hours of reports.

**Carmen:** Some customers really do love it. I've had a few say it's exactly what they needed.

## What Didn't Go Well

**Carmen:** [Deep breath] Can I be honest? We have a lot of problems.

I've handled 300+ tickets in two weeks. By myself. The top issues:
1. Setup is confusing - 40% of tickets
2. Mobile app is slow - 25% of tickets
3. Calendar sync bugs - 15% of tickets
4. Missing features (buffer time keeps coming up) - 10%
5. Enterprise features not working as expected - 5%
6. Other - 5%

**Marcus:** This tracks with what I was worried about.

**Dana:** Let's focus on solutions, not blame.

**Marcus:** I'm not blaming anyone. I'm saying we launched before we were ready, and the data supports that.

**Dana:** We discussed this in August. The decision was made.

**Marcus:** And I disagreed then. The record will show that.

**[Tense silence]**

**Jerome:** The calendar sync issue was a bug in the Google API handling. It's fixed now.

**Pete:** But we have technical debt everywhere. The mobile app is slow because we rushed it. I told everyone this in September. We need at least 3 weeks to optimize it properly.

**Dana:** Then let's prioritize that.

**Pete:** With what resources? I'm also supposed to be adding enterprise features, improving onboarding, AND fixing bugs. I can't do everything.

## Enterprise Discussion

**Dana:** Speaking of enterprise—any leads?

**Aaliyah:** I've had two demo requests. Both went poorly.

**Dana:** What happened?

**Aaliyah:** They asked questions I couldn't answer. "What's your SLA?" We don't have one. "Can you sign a BAA for HIPAA?" We can't. "Do you have SOC 2 compliance?" We don't. They thanked me for my time and never called back.

**Dana:** We need to build these things.

**Marcus:** Dana, with respect—these aren't features we can just "build." SOC 2 compliance is a 6-month process minimum. HIPAA requires infrastructure changes. We don't have the resources to become an enterprise company right now.

**Jerome:** We could get SOC 2 started. I know a consultant.

**Marcus:** That's $30-50K and months of work. Is that the best use of our runway?

**Dana:** Enterprise is the path to real revenue.

**Aaliyah:** But our actual paying customers are solopreneurs. Shouldn't we focus on keeping them?

**Dana:** $12/month customers aren't going to make this company profitable.

**Carmen:** Those $12/month customers are the ones emailing me every day. And they're leaving.

## The Real Argument (capturing this for the record)

**Marcus:** Can I say something directly?

**Dana:** Go ahead.

**Marcus:** We made a strategic mistake. We built enterprise features nobody wanted while ignoring basic features our users were asking for. Buffer time between appointments—salons have been begging for this. It would take Pete maybe a week to build. Instead, he built SSO that nobody is using.

**Jerome:** SSO was the right call. Enterprise clients expect it.

**Marcus:** What enterprise clients? We have zero. We have 89 paying customers and 80 of them are on Solo and Team plans.

**Dana:** We're investing in the future.

**Marcus:** We're 8 months from running out of money. We need to survive the present before we invest in the future.

**[Long pause]**

**Dana:** This isn't productive. Let's move on.

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Mobile performance:** Priority for Pete, target fix in 3 weeks
2. **Onboarding:** Marcus to simplify, target improvement in 2 weeks
3. **Support:** Will hire contractor to help Carmen (budget TBD)
4. **Enterprise:** Continue to pursue (Dana and Jerome)
5. **Buffer time:** Added to roadmap, no timeline set

**My observation (Aaliyah):** No real decisions were made about strategy. We're still trying to do everything. Mobile will get fixed but the fundamental issue—who is this product for—remains unresolved.

## Post-Meeting Conversations

After the meeting, Marcus and I talked privately.

**Marcus:** I'm starting to look for other jobs. I don't think I can change their minds.

**Aaliyah:** Please don't leave. You're the only one pushing back.

**Marcus:** I've been pushing back for months. Nothing changes. Dana wants enterprise because it's more "prestigious." Jerome wants to build technically interesting things. Neither of them are listening to customers.

**Aaliyah:** What about Carmen's data? The support tickets are clear.

**Marcus:** Dana called it "growing pains." Jerome said we should focus on users who "get it." They're not hearing it.

---

This meeting was frustrating. We have data showing what's wrong, team members saying what's wrong, and leadership not changing course.

I don't know how long this can continue.
