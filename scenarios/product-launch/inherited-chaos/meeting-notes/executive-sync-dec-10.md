## Current Situation

**Dana:** Let's be real about where we are. Marcus is clearly checked out. He's been talking about "strategic mistakes" in every meeting. It's becoming disruptive.

**Jerome:** He's not wrong about some things. The launch didn't go as planned.

**Dana:** The launch was fine. We got 1,200 signups. The problem is execution—mobile app issues, support being overwhelmed. Those are fixable.

**Jerome:** What about his point on enterprise vs. SMB?

**Dana:** I still believe enterprise is the right long-term play. Small businesses churn constantly. Enterprise contracts are sticky.

**Jerome:** We don't have any enterprise customers.

**Dana:** Yet. We don't have any yet. It takes time to build an enterprise sales motion.

**Jerome:** Do we have time? Runway is about 8 months.

**Dana:** Which is exactly why we need bigger contracts. A few $50K enterprise deals would change everything.

## Marcus Situation

**Dana:** I think Marcus is going to leave.

**Jerome:** Probably. He's been quiet lately, which isn't like him.

**Dana:** Part of me thinks that's fine. He's been negative since August.

**Jerome:** He raised valid concerns. We just didn't agree with them.

**Dana:** There's a difference between raising concerns and undermining leadership. His "I told you so" attitude isn't helping anyone.

**Jerome:** What do we do if he leaves?

**Dana:** Promote from within or hire a replacement. Product management isn't rocket science.

## Path Forward

**Dana:** Here's what I'm thinking:

1. **Double down on enterprise.** I'm going to reach out to my Detroit network personally. Car dealerships, healthcare systems, professional services firms.

2. **Fix the mobile app.** That's Pete's priority.

3. **Hire a support contractor.** Carmen is a flight risk if we don't help her.

4. **Consider pivoting to automotive vertical.** I have deep relationships there. What if BookIt became the scheduling platform for dealerships?

**Jerome:** Automotive is interesting. Service appointments, test drives, sales consultations—they all need scheduling.

**Dana:** And they're used to paying for software. Dealerships spend $50K+ on CRM tools.

**Jerome:** Would require some customization. Dealerships have specific workflows.

**Dana:** But you could build that.

**Jerome:** I could. I'd need to pull resources from other things.

**Dana:** What if we paused the SMB roadmap and focused entirely on automotive?

**Jerome:** That's a big pivot. What about our existing customers?

**Dana:** Keep the product running but stop building for them. Focus all new development on dealership features.

**Jerome:** Marcus would hate this.

**Dana:** Marcus might not be here much longer.

## Concerns (Jerome's section)

**I'm adding my own thoughts here because this meeting concerned me:**

Dana is frustrated and looking for a quick fix. Enterprise pivot or automotive pivot—she's throwing ideas at the wall.

My concerns:
1. We're 8 months from running out of money and she wants to do a major pivot?
2. Automotive would require significant development work. We don't have capacity.
3. We're ignoring what's actually working—solo consultants and small service businesses.
4. If we pivot to automotive and it doesn't work, we're dead.

Also: Dana is treating Marcus's concerns as "negativity" but a lot of what he said was right. We DID launch too early. We DID prioritize enterprise features nobody wanted. The data supports his position.

I'm not going to say this to Dana directly because she's not in a place to hear it. But I'm documenting it here.

## Action Items

- Dana to reach out to 5 automotive contacts this week
- Jerome to scope dealership-specific features
- Pete to continue mobile optimization
- HR to start contractor search for support

## My Reflection (Jerome, not shared)

I've been loyal to Dana since we started this company. But I'm worried she's making emotional decisions.

The enterprise push came from her wanting BookIt to be "serious" and "respected." The automotive pivot is because she knows people in that industry.

Neither of these are based on what customers are telling us.

Carmen's data is clear: small service businesses like the product when it works. They want simple improvements—buffer time, better onboarding, faster mobile.

If I were making this decision alone, I'd:
1. Abandon enterprise entirely
2. Focus on solo and small team users
3. Nail the basics (mobile, onboarding, buffer time)
4. Pick one vertical (salons?) and go deep

But I'm not making this decision alone. And Dana is the CEO.

I hope we figure this out before it's too late.
