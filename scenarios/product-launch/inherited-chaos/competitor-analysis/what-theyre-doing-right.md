# What Our Competitors Are Doing Right

## The Big Picture

I've spent the last month studying Calendly, Acuity, Square, and a dozen smaller players. Here's what I've learned:

**The winners in scheduling all do one thing really well. They pick a lane.**

- Calendly = Simple meeting scheduling
- Acuity = Feature-rich for service businesses
- Square = Integrated payments ecosystem
- Vagaro = Beauty and wellness vertical
- Mindbody = Fitness studios
- Jane App = Healthcare practices

**We're trying to be all of them. And we're worse than each at their specialty.**

## What Calendly Does Right

### 1. Ruthless Simplicity
You can set up a Calendly account and have a working booking link in under 5 minutes. That's not an exaggeration—I timed it.

Our setup takes 45+ minutes and people STILL don't finish.

### 2. The Free Tier Is Actually Good
Calendly's free tier is legitimately useful. You can book meetings, sync calendars, send reminders. It works.

Our free tier is so limited it's basically a demo. Nobody stays on it.

### 3. They Know Who They're For
Calendly doesn't try to serve salons or fitness studios. They serve knowledge workers who need to book meetings. Every feature supports that use case.

We're trying to serve everyone and serving no one well.

## What Acuity Does Right

### 1. Feature Depth for Their Market
Acuity has buffer time, intake forms, packages, gift certificates, HIPAA compliance—everything a service business needs. They've been adding these features for 18 years based on real user feedback.

We launched with enterprise SSO (nobody asked for it) and skipped buffer time (everyone asks for it).

### 2. Affordable Team Pricing
$34/month for 6 staff is genuinely affordable for a small salon. Our $29 Team plan only goes to 5 staff, and doesn't have the features they need.

### 3. They Earn Trust Through Reliability
Acuity just works. I couldn't find recent complaints about bugs, data loss, or sync issues. They're boring and that's good.

We launched and broke calendar sync within a month.

---

## What Square Does Right

### 1. Ecosystem Lock-In (But Useful Lock-In)
If you're on Square for payments, Appointments is a no-brainer add-on. They made the switching cost very low to start and very high to leave.

### 2. Free Is a Real Strategy
Free Appointments for single users gets people in. Once they hire, they upgrade. It's patient monetization.

### 3. Distribution Advantage
They don't need to win on product because they win on distribution. 4M sellers already using Square is an unfair advantage.

---

## What Vagaro Does Right (Industry-Specific Competitor)

### 1. They OWN Beauty/Wellness
Vagaro is built specifically for salons, spas, and fitness. Every feature is designed for that use case:
- Booth rental management
- Membership programs
- Client history and notes
- Product sales
- Waiting list
- Rebooking reminders
- Commission tracking

We have none of this. We have enterprise SSO.

### 2. Vertical-Specific Marketing
Their content, ads, and partnerships are all beauty/wellness focused. They sponsor salon shows, partner with beauty schools, etc.

### 3. Marketplace Effect
Vagaro has a consumer-facing directory. Users can discover businesses through the app. Network effect.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Here's what I didn't want to write in a company doc, but it's true:

**BookIt doesn't have a clear reason to exist.**

- If I need simple meeting scheduling → Calendly is better
- If I need feature-rich service scheduling → Acuity is better
- If I use Square for payments → Square Appointments is better (and free)
- If I run a salon → Vagaro is better
- If I run a fitness studio → Mindbody is better
- If I need enterprise scheduling → Enterprise tools like Microsoft Bookings are better

**When would someone choose BookIt?**

I've been asking myself this for months. The honest answer: I don't know.

We COULD have an answer. There's a gap for:
- Modern, simple scheduling for small service businesses
- Focus on mobile experience (most competitors are desktop-first)
- A specific vertical done really, really well

But we're not building that. We're building a little bit of everything.

## My Recommendation (That I Never Got to Present)

### Option 1: Vertical Focus
Pick ONE vertical. I'd suggest beauty/wellness (salons, spas, massage, etc.).

Why:
- Strong early adopters in this space
- Clear feature gaps we could fill
- Large market ($47B industry)
- Acuity is generic, Vagaro is clunky—room for a modern alternative

What it means:
- Kill enterprise
- Build buffer time, rebooking, waitlists
- Industry-specific templates
- Market specifically to salons

### Option 2: The "Simple" Play
Be the Calendly for services businesses. Ruthlessly simple.

Why:
- Complexity is killing us
- There's a gap between Calendly (too simple for services) and Acuity (too complex)

What it means:
- Cut features, not add them
- Fix mobile performance
- Nail onboarding
- Free tier that's actually useful

### Option 3: Keep Doing What We're Doing
Try to be everything for everyone.

What it means:
- Continue to lose
- Run out of money in ~8 months
- Everyone finds new jobs

I was going to present this before leaving. Never got the chance. Maybe someone will read it.
