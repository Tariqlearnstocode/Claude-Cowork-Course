## Company Overview

**Founded:** 2006
**Acquired by:** Squarespace in 2019 (terms undisclosed)
**Headquarters:** Part of Squarespace (NYC)

## Product

**Core offering:** Appointment scheduling for service businesses

**Key features:**
- Customizable booking pages

## Pricing

| Plan | Price | Staff | Key Features |
|------|-------|-------|--------------|
| Emerging | $20/mo | 1 | Basic scheduling, payments |
| Growing | $34/mo | 6 | + SMS, Zoom, more customization |
| Powerhouse | $61/mo | 36 | + Advanced reports, HIPAA option |

**Note:** Pricing is per-business, not per-user. Much more affordable for teams than Calendly.

**HIPAA add-on:** $20/mo extra (Powerhouse only)

## Target Market

- **Primary:** Service-based small businesses
  - Wellness (massage, spas, yoga)
  - Personal care (salons, barbers)
  - Fitness (trainers, studios)
  - Professional services (consultants, coaches)
- **Secondary:** Photographers, tutors, healthcare (with HIPAA)

This is our direct competitor. They're going after the same market we should be targeting.

---

## Strengths

1. **Feature depth** - Everything a service business needs
2. **Squarespace integration** - Built-in customer base
3. **Affordable team pricing** - Not per-user
4. **HIPAA option** - Opens healthcare market
5. **Reliability** - Mature product, few complaints
6. **Mobile experience** - Better than ours

---

## Weaknesses

1. **UI is dated** - Looks like it was designed in 2015 (because it was)
2. **Squarespace dependency** - Best features require Squarespace
3. **Learning curve** - Lots of settings, takes time to configure
4. **No API on lower tiers** - Limits customization
5. **Customer support** - Mixed reviews, slow responses

---

## How They Win

- Feature completeness for their target market
- Price advantage vs. Calendly for teams
- Squarespace cross-sell (500K+ Squarespace customers)
- Long track record (trust factor)

## How We Could Beat Them

*Marcus's notes (September):*

Honestly? This is a tough competitor. They've been at this for 18 years.

Options:
1. **Better UX** - Their interface is clunky. We could be simpler AND powerful.
2. **Better mobile** - If we fix our mobile app, we could win here
3. **Vertical focus** - They're generic. We could own ONE vertical deeply (salons?)
4. **Pricing** - Undercut them on the low end

What we probably can't do:
- Out-feature them (we're way behind)
- Win on trust (they've been around forever)
- Compete on Squarespace integration

---

## Key Insight

Acuity is the incumbent for service business scheduling. They're feature-rich but dated and complex. There's a gap for something that's:
- Modern and simple
- Purpose-built for a specific vertical
- Mobile-first

But we're not that right now. We're trying to be everything, and we're worse than Acuity at most things.

---

*Marcus's honest assessment: If I were a salon owner, I'd pick Acuity over BookIt right now. We need to either catch up on features or differentiate sharply. We're doing neither.*
