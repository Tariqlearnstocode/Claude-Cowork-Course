## Pricing

| Standard | $12/user/mo | Unlimited events, team features |
| Teams | $20/user/mo | Workflows, routing, analytics |
| Enterprise | Custom | SSO, SCIM, admin controls |

## Target Market

- **Primary:** Knowledge workers, sales teams, consultants
- **Secondary:** Small businesses, freelancers
- **Moving toward:** Enterprise

Calendly is optimized for meeting scheduling (sales calls, interviews, consultations), not ongoing service appointments.

---

## Strengths

1. **Brand recognition** - "Calendly" is basically synonymous with scheduling
2. **Simplicity** - Dead simple setup, 5-minute onboarding
3. **Integrations** - Connects with everything
4. **Free tier** - Great way to get users in the door
5. **Reliable** - I couldn't find complaints about bugs or downtime

---

## Weaknesses

1. **Not built for services businesses** - No service catalog, no buffer time (recently added as "padding"), limited for ongoing client relationships
2. **Per-user pricing** - Gets expensive for teams
3. **Generic** - No industry-specific features
4. **US-centric** - Limited internationalization

---

## How They Win

- Top-of-funnel content marketing (they rank #1 for "scheduling app")
- Free tier creates massive user base
- Network effect (when someone sends you a Calendly link, you learn about Calendly)
- Product-led growth, minimal sales needed for SMB

## How We Could Beat Them

*My suggestions:*

1. **Target markets they ignore** - Salons, fitness, wellness, auto shops—people who book services, not meetings
2. **Feature depth for specific verticals** - Buffer time, service add-ons, rebooking reminders, waitlists
3. **Simpler team pricing** - Flat rate instead of per-user
4. **Local/relationship marketing** - They're a big company; we can be personal

## Key Insight

Calendly optimizes for one-off meetings, not ongoing service relationships. A consultant booking a sales call has different needs than a massage therapist booking repeat clients.

BookIt could win by owning the "service business scheduling" space that Calendly treats as an afterthought.

*Side note: I suggested this positioning in my internship report but nobody responded to it. Maybe worth revisiting? —Jasmine*
