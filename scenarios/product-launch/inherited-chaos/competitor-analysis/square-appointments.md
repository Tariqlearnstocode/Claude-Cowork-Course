## Company Overview

**Parent Company:** Block, Inc. (fka Square)
**Product launched:** 2014
**Block market cap:** ~$40B (2024)
**Square ecosystem:** 4M+ sellers

Square Appointments is part of the larger Square ecosystem (payments, POS, payroll, banking). They're not just a scheduling company—they're an everything company.

## Pricing

| Plan | Price | Key Features |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | 1 user, basic scheduling |
| Plus | $29/mo | Multiple staff, no-show fees |
| Premium | $69/mo | Advanced features, resource management |

Per-location pricing (not per-user) makes this attractive for teams.

**Hidden cost:** Square takes 2.6% + 10¢ per transaction (higher than Stripe for most businesses)

---

## Target Market

- **Primary:** Local service businesses that also take in-person payments
  - Salons and barbers
  - Spas
  - Auto services
  - Home services
- **Secondary:** Anyone already in Square ecosystem

Key insight: Square Appointments exists to keep people in the Square ecosystem, not to be the best scheduling app.

## Strengths

1. **Free tier** - Hard to beat free
2. **Ecosystem integration** - If you use Square POS, this is the obvious choice
3. **Buffer time** - Has what we don't
4. **Brand trust** - Square is a known quantity
5. **Instagram/Google booking** - Great acquisition channels

---

## Weaknesses

1. **Square lock-in** - Most valuable if you're all-in on Square
2. **Limited customization** - Can't brand as much as competitors
3. **No standalone value** - If you don't use Square payments, other tools are better
4. **Enterprise features** - Doesn't serve larger businesses
5. **Payment processing fees** - Adds up if you have high volume

---

## How They Win

- **Distribution:** 4M+ Square sellers already. Just turn on Appointments.
- **Free tier:** No risk to try
- **Ecosystem stickiness:** Once you're on Square for payments, why use a separate scheduling tool?

---

## How We Could Beat Them

*My thoughts:*

We probably can't beat Square for their core market (businesses using Square POS).

But we could win:
1. **Users who don't want Square payments** - Some prefer Stripe, PayPal, or cash
2. **Online-only services** - Consultants, virtual appointments, etc.
3. **More customization** - Branding, booking page flexibility
4. **Better standalone product** - Square Appointments is meh without the ecosystem

---

## Key Insight

Square Appointments is a feature of Square, not a standalone scheduling product. They win through distribution and ecosystem lock-in, not product excellence.

If someone is evaluating scheduling tools independently (not already on Square), we can compete. But we won't peel people away from the Square ecosystem.

## Competitive Threat Level

**For us: MEDIUM-HIGH**

They're not the best scheduling tool, but they're free and integrated. Hard to compete with free, especially when it works "well enough."

Our best bet: Focus on users who want more than "well enough" and don't want to be locked into Square.
