# Support Tickets - November 2024 Summary

*Compiled by Carmen Reyes, Customer Support*

I'm pulling these together because nobody seems to be reading them individually. These are real tickets from real customers. PLEASE let's actually address some of this.

---

## Ticket #1847 - Nov 3, 2024
**Customer:** Sunrise Yoga Studio (Team Plan)
**Subject:** Calendar sync lost all my appointments

> We had 47 appointments scheduled for this week. After your last update, they all disappeared from my Google Calendar. My instructors showed up to empty classes. This is unacceptable. We are looking at other options.

**Status:** Partially resolved - manually restored data
**Root cause:** Calendar sync bug introduced in 1.2.3
**Customer status:** Churned on Nov 15

## Ticket #1852 - Nov 5, 2024
**Customer:** Mike's Mobile Detailing (Solo Plan)
**Subject:** I don't understand how to set up my services

> I've been trying for 2 hours to add my services. Where do I put the prices? Why are there so many settings? I just want people to book a car wash. This is way more complicated than it needs to be.

**Status:** Resolved via screen share
**Time spent:** 45 minutes with customer
**Customer status:** Active but only using basic features

**MY NOTE:** This is the third "where do I put prices" ticket THIS WEEK. The settings are genuinely confusing. I've flagged this before.

## Ticket #1863 - Nov 8, 2024
**Customer:** Executive Coach (anonymous, Solo Plan)
**Subject:** Mobile app is unusable

> The mobile app takes forever to load. I'm often on-site with clients and need to check my schedule quickly. By the time your app loads, I could have just called my assistant. And it crashed twice yesterday.

**Status:** Acknowledged - known issue
**Response sent:** "We're working on performance improvements"
**Customer status:** Churned on Nov 20

## Ticket #1871 - Nov 10, 2024
**Customer:** Hair Haven Salon (Team Plan)
**Subject:** We need buffer time between appointments!!!

> My stylists need at least 15 minutes between clients to clean stations and prepare. There's no way to set this up automatically. I have to manually block time after every single appointment. This is a basic feature. Calendly has this.

**Status:** Feature request logged (FR-026)
**Customer status:** Active but frustrated

**MY NOTE:** This is the FIFTH salon to ask for this. It's standard in every competitor. Why isn't this prioritized???

---

## Ticket #1879 - Nov 12, 2024
**Customer:** Detroit Counseling Services (Team Plan)
**Subject:** HIPAA compliance question

> We were told by your sales page that BookIt could work for healthcare providers. We signed up for the Team plan but now realize there's no BAA available and the system isn't HIPAA compliant. We need a refund and are very disappointed.

**Status:** Refund processed
**Customer status:** Churned immediately

**MY NOTE:** Our website does NOT claim HIPAA compliance, but it also doesn't clearly say we're NOT compliant. Healthcare providers keep signing up and then leaving when they realize. We need to be clearer about this.

---

## Ticket #1885 - Nov 14, 2024
**Customer:** The Barber Collective (Team Plan)
**Subject:** Feature request: rebooking reminders

> Love the app overall! One thing that would be huge: automatic reminders to rebook. Most of my clients come every 4-6 weeks. If you could text them "time for a haircut?" after 5 weeks, that would save me so much time.

**Status:** Feature request logged (FR-031)
**Customer status:** Active and engaged

**MY NOTE:** This is actually a happy customer! They have good ideas! Can we please talk to people like this???

## Ticket #1891 - Nov 17, 2024
**Customer:** Fitness First Training (Solo Plan)
**Subject:** Group classes don't work right

> I signed up because you said you support group classes. But when someone books into a class, it doesn't show them who else is signed up or how many spots are left. And I can't track attendance. This is half-baked.

**Status:** Acknowledged - known limitation
**Customer status:** Active, considering downgrade

**MY NOTE:** The group class feature was rushed out. It's not complete. We shouldn't be advertising it.

---

## Ticket #1903 - Nov 22, 2024
**Customer:** Anonymous (via chat widget)
**Subject:** N/A (live chat)

> Chat transcript:
>
> User: hi is anyone there
> User: hello?
> User: I just want to know the difference between Team and Business plans
> User: your pricing page is confusing
> User: the features list is identical except for "priority support"
> User: what does priority support even mean
> User: ok I'm signing up for calendly bye
>
> [User disconnected]

**Status:** N/A - lost prospect
**Customer status:** Never converted

**MY NOTE:** I wasn't available because I was on another ticket. We need more support staff or better self-service docs. Also, they're right—the pricing page IS confusing.

## My Recommendations (AGAIN)

1. **Fix onboarding.** I spend half my time walking people through setup that should be intuitive.

2. **Fix mobile performance.** Every service provider needs to check their schedule on their phone. This is non-negotiable.

3. **Add buffer time feature.** It's basic. Every salon and spa asks for it. Our competitors have it.

4. **Clarify our target market.** We get healthcare providers, enterprise companies, and event venues signing up and then churning because we're not built for them.

5. **Hire another support person.** I am drowning. I literally cried at my desk on November 10th.

Please, someone listen to this.
