Subject: Disappointed long-time supporter - considering leaving

Hi,

I don't normally write emails like this, but I've been a BookIt user since the beta and I feel like I need to say something.

I found BookIt in May when you were still in development. I was one of your first 50 users. I gave feedback on the early versions. I recommended you to three other yoga instructors. I genuinely believed in what you were building.

But I have to be honest: the product has gotten WORSE since launch, not better.

Here's what's happened:

1. **The app is slower than ever.** I used to be able to check my schedule quickly between classes. Now it takes 10-15 seconds to load. I've started keeping a paper backup again.

2. **Features I was promised never came.** When I signed up, Marcus (your PM) told me ClassPass integration was "on the roadmap for Q4." It's December. No ClassPass. I asked again in November and got told it's "not currently prioritized."

3. **Group class scheduling is broken.** This was a big selling point for me. But I can't show class capacity to students, I can't track attendance properly, and the waitlist feature that was supposed to come never materialized.

4. **You're building stuff nobody asked for.** I see you added "enterprise SSO" and "API access." Who asked for this? I'm a yoga instructor. My colleagues are massage therapists and personal trainers. We don't need enterprise SSO. We need buffer time between appointments (still not there!!) and working class scheduling.

5. **Nobody listens.** I've submitted feature requests. I've filled out surveys. I've talked to Carmen (who is wonderful and clearly overwhelmed). Nothing changes. But somehow you had time to build enterprise features?

I looked at your pricing page recently and saw you now have an "Enterprise" tier. I have to ask: who is this product actually for? Because it doesn't feel like it's for people like me anymore.

Here's the thing—I WANT to stay. I've invested time in setting up my booking page, my clients know the link, I've built workflows around BookIt. Switching would be painful.

But I'm not going to pay for a product that doesn't work while the company chases enterprise clients who will never come.

I'm giving you until the end of January. If I don't see meaningful improvements to:
- Mobile app performance
- Group class scheduling
- Basic features like buffer time

Then I'm moving to Acuity. I've already done a trial and it has everything I need.

Please prove me wrong. I really want to stay.

P.S. - I CC'd Dana because I want leadership to see this. I'm not the only one feeling this way. Check your churn numbers.

*[Internal note from Carmen, added to file Dec 9]*

I forwarded this to Marcus before he left. He said "I know, I know." Dana saw it and asked for an "enterprise case study" instead. I don't know what else to do.

Yolanda is exactly our target user. She LOVES the product concept. She's been an advocate. If we're losing people like her, who are we keeping?
