## iOS App Store

### 1 Star - "Waste of time" - Nov 2, 2024
*By SalonOwnerSarah*

Tried to set this up for my hair salon. Spent two hours and couldn't figure out how to add my stylists properly. The interface is cluttered and confusing. Going back to Acuity.

**Developer response:** We're sorry to hear about your experience. We'd love to help you get set up—please contact support@motorcityapps.com.

### 2 Stars - "Good idea, poor execution" - Nov 8, 2024
*By MikeTheTrainer*

The concept is fine but the app is SLOW. Takes forever to load my schedule. I need to see my appointments quickly between clients. Can't wait 10+ seconds every time. Also, the Android version crashes constantly.

**Developer response:** Thank you for the feedback. Performance improvements are our top priority.

### 5 Stars - "Perfect for my needs" - Nov 12, 2024
*By FreelanceWriter42*

I'm a freelance writer and just need a simple way for clients to book calls with me. BookIt does exactly that. Easy to set up, works great. Don't understand the negative reviews—maybe they're trying to do too much with it?

**Developer response:** Thank you! We're glad BookIt is working for you!

### 2 Stars - "Missing basic features" - Nov 15, 2024
*By NailTechNancy*

No buffer time between appointments? Every nail tech needs cleanup time. This is Scheduling 101. Also can't set up breaks easily. Had to switch to Square Appointments which has all this built in.

**Developer response:** Thank you for this feedback—we're working on adding buffer time functionality.

### 3 Stars - "Decent but needs work" - Nov 20, 2024
*By YogaWithYolanda*

Been using this for a few months. It's okay for basic scheduling but the group class feature is incomplete. Can't see class capacity or track who attended. Fine for 1:1 sessions but if you do groups, look elsewhere.

**Developer response:** We appreciate the detailed feedback and are continuing to improve our group scheduling features.

### 1 Star - "Lost my appointments!!" - Nov 22, 2024
*By AngrySalonManager*

The sync with Google Calendar broke and I lost a week of appointments. Clients showed up with no record of their bookings. Completely unprofessional. Switching immediately.

**Developer response:** We sincerely apologize for this issue. It was caused by a bug in version 1.2.3 that has since been fixed. Please contact support for assistance with data recovery.

### 4 Stars - "Almost there" - Nov 28, 2024
*By CoachDan*

Pretty good for basic scheduling. I like the Stripe integration and the reminder system. Took off a star because the mobile app is slow and the settings are confusing. Would recommend for solo consultants.

**Developer response:** Thanks for the feedback, Dan! We're working on mobile performance.

### 1 Star - "Enterprise features are a joke" - Dec 1, 2024
*By ITManagerJim*

We evaluated this for our company (50+ employees). They advertise "enterprise features" but it's just basic SSO and an API. No audit logs worth mentioning, no compliance features, no SLA, no dedicated support. Not enterprise-ready by any definition. Save your time.

**Developer response:** Thank you for evaluating BookIt. We'd love to understand your enterprise needs better—please reach out to enterprise@motorcityapps.com.

### 3 Stars - "Good for what it is" - Dec 5, 2024
*By BarbershopBill*

Solid basic scheduling. My customers can book online, I get reminders, it syncs with my calendar. That's all I need. Mobile app is slow but I mostly use it on my computer anyway. Price is fair.

**Developer response:** Thanks for the review, Bill! Glad it's working for your shop.

### 2 Stars - "Too many features, none work well" - Dec 12, 2024
*By TherapistMaria*

It feels like they tried to build everything but didn't finish anything. There's enterprise features (why?), group scheduling (half-broken), integrations (unreliable), team management (confusing). I just want simple appointment booking. Calendly is simpler and cheaper for what I need.

**Developer response:** We appreciate the honest feedback. Simplicity is something we're actively working to improve.

## Google Play Store

### 1 Star - "Crashes constantly" - Oct 18, 2024
*By user293847*

Downloaded after seeing an ad. App crashed 3 times before I could even finish signup. Uninstalling.

### 2 Stars - "Works but barely" - Nov 1, 2024
*By autodetailer_mike*

Slow and buggy. Takes forever to load. When it works it's fine but I don't have time to wait for apps to load when I'm running between jobs.

---

### 5 Stars - "Love it!" - Nov 10, 2024
*By smallbizsara*

Perfect for my consulting business. Easy setup, clients love being able to book directly. The calendar sync works great (using Outlook).

---

### 1 Star - "What enterprise?" - Dec 3, 2024
*By corpIT_reviewer*

"Enterprise" tier is a joke. No multi-tenant support, no proper admin controls, no compliance. This is a small business app pretending to be enterprise. Don't waste your procurement team's time.

---

### 3 Stars - "Fine for basics" - Dec 15, 2024
*By fitnesscoach_dee*

Does the basics okay. Wish it had better class scheduling. The individual session booking works fine. App is slow though—needs optimization.

## Review Summary

**Positive themes:**
- Works well for simple 1:1 scheduling
- Freelancers and solo consultants are happy
- Calendar sync works (when it works)
- Competitive pricing

**Negative themes:**
- Mobile app performance (mentioned in 60%+ of negative reviews)
- Too complex/confusing interface
- Missing basic features (buffer time, etc.)
- Enterprise features are inadequate
- Group scheduling is incomplete
- Calendar sync bugs

**Notable pattern:** The positive reviews almost all come from solo practitioners with simple needs. The negative reviews come from businesses trying to use team features, group scheduling, or enterprise functionality.
