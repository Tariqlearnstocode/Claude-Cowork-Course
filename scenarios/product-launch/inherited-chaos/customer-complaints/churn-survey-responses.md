## Question 3: What would have made you stay?

*Open text responses (selected, representative sample)*

---

**Response #12** (Solo Plan, Massage Therapist)
> "Simpler setup. I spent hours trying to configure everything and still wasn't sure I did it right. Calendly took me 15 minutes."

---

**Response #18** (Team Plan, Hair Salon)
> "Buffer time between appointments. I asked for this 4 times. It's such a basic feature. Square has it. Acuity has it. Everyone has it except you."

---

**Response #24** (Solo Plan, Business Consultant)
> "A mobile app that actually works. I can't wait 10 seconds every time I need to check my schedule. That's insane."

---

**Response #31** (Team Plan, Fitness Studio)
> "Better group class features. We do 30% of our business in classes. Your class scheduling is clearly an afterthought. We needed: capacity display, waitlists, attendance tracking, check-in functionality. You had none of this."

---

**Response #37** (Business Plan, Dental Office)
> "HIPAA compliance. We assumed any business scheduling tool would have basic healthcare compliance. We were wrong. Had to leave after our compliance officer found out."

---

**Response #42** (Solo Plan, Pet Groomer)
> "Honestly, nothing. I realized I don't need scheduling software. My phone calendar works fine for 10-15 appointments a week. BookIt is overkill for what I do."

---

**Response #48** (Team Plan, Consulting Firm)
> "Fewer features, done better. You have too many half-baked things. I don't need enterprise SSO. I need the basics to work reliably."

---

**Response #55** (Enterprise Trial, Tech Company)
> "Actual enterprise features. We evaluated for our 200-person services team. Your 'enterprise' tier is a Solo product with SSO bolted on. No admin dashboard, no department management, no approval workflows, no compliance reporting. Don't call it enterprise if it isn't."

---

**Response #61** (Solo Plan, Life Coach)
> "Intake forms. I need clients to fill out a questionnaire before our first session. You don't have this. Calendly does. Decision was easy."

---

**Response #67** (Team Plan, Auto Shop)
> "Just make it simpler. We're mechanics, not software engineers. We need a calendar that customers can book into. Instead we got a complicated system with settings we don't understand."

---

**Response #73** (Solo Plan, Freelance Designer)
> "Nothing—I actually liked BookIt! But my client load dropped and I couldn't justify $12/month for 3-4 bookings. Wish there was a cheaper tier for light users."

---

**Response #78** (Team Plan, Spa)
> "Listen to salon/spa owners. We're clearly a big chunk of your users but the product isn't built for us. No buffer time, no rebooking reminders, no service add-ons. We need a tool built for beauty and wellness, not generic scheduling."

---

**Response #84** (Business Plan, Event Space)
> "Resource scheduling. We book rooms, not people. Your tool is designed for services businesses with staff. We needed room booking, equipment, catering add-ons. Wrong product for us."

---

## Question 4: How would you rate your overall BookIt experience?

| Rating | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| 1 - Very Poor | 19 | 21% |
| 2 - Poor | 28 | 31% |
| 3 - Okay | 31 | 35% |
| 4 - Good | 9 | 10% |
| 5 - Excellent | 2 | 2% |

**Average: 2.4 / 5**

---

## Question 5: Would you recommend BookIt to a friend or colleague?

| Response | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Definitely not | 24 | 27% |
| Probably not | 33 | 37% |
| Maybe | 22 | 25% |
| Probably yes | 8 | 9% |
| Definitely yes | 2 | 2% |

**NPS Score: -47** (Detractors: 57, Promoters: 10)

## Analysis Notes (by Carmen)

### Patterns I'm seeing:

1. **Complexity is killing us.** "Too difficult" and "simpler" appear in almost half the responses. We're scaring away small business owners.

2. **We're losing to focused competitors.** Calendly wins on simplicity. Acuity wins on features for specific verticals. Square wins on integration with their existing POS users.

3. **The "enterprise" play isn't working.** Enterprise prospects evaluate us and leave because we're not enterprise-ready. Meanwhile, we alienated small users by building enterprise stuff instead of their features.

4. **Beauty/wellness is a missed opportunity.** Salons, spas, massage therapists—they WANT a product like ours. But we're not building for them. They all ask for the same things: buffer time, rebooking, service add-ons.

5. **Mobile performance is a dealbreaker.** Service providers check their schedule 20+ times a day. If the app is slow, they'll leave.

### My recommendation (again):

Pick a lane. Either go enterprise (which we're not ready for) or focus on small service businesses (which we could actually win). Right now we're failing at both.
