> Cool to see @MotorCityApps launching products. BookIt looks interesting but seems like they're trying to compete with Calendly AND Salesforce at the same time? Pick a lane guys

> I've been using it since beta. It's...fine? Mobile app is slow. Missing some features. Honestly might switch soon 😕

> MotorCity Apps raised $1.2M in 2020 and just launched BookIt. First review: It's okay but Calendly's free tier does 80% of what the paid BookIt does. Tough market.

> AVOID BookIt. Lost a week of appointments when their calendar sync broke. They said "sorry" and offered me one free month. Not worth the risk.

**r/smallbusiness** - Nov 22, 2024
**Title:** Scheduling app recommendations for nail salon?

> I have a small nail salon with 3 technicians. Need a booking app that handles:
> - Multiple staff calendars
> - Buffer time between appointments
> - Deposit payments
> - Client reminders
>
> Budget: ~$50/month total

**Top comment (48 upvotes):**
> Square Appointments is free for single users, $30/mo for teams. Has everything you need plus integrates with Square POS. Vagarou is also popular in salons.

**Reply:**
> Tried BookIt? It's newer and seems to have team features

**Reply to that (12 upvotes):**
> Tried it. Couldn't set up buffer time which is a dealbreaker. Returned to Acuity.

**r/Entrepreneur** - Dec 2, 2024
**Title:** Why is enterprise B2B software always so expensive?

> Looking at scheduling software for my consulting firm (25 people). Calendly Teams is $16/user/month = $400/mo. Acuity Business is $46/mo but limited. Found this BookIt app with "Enterprise" tier but they don't list pricing—always a bad sign.

**Comment (23 upvotes):**
> Called BookIt for enterprise pricing. It's actually cheap (~$200/mo) but after a demo, the "enterprise" features are basically SSO and that's it. No real admin tools. You get what you pay for.

**r/yoga** - Dec 8, 2024
**Title:** Best booking system for yoga studio?

> Solo yoga instructor, do 1:1 sessions and small group classes. Need something simple. Currently using Calendly but it doesn't handle groups well.

**Comment:**
> Try Momence or WellnessLiving—built specifically for fitness/yoga

**Comment:**
> Avoid BookIt. The group class feature is half-baked.

> Anyone tried BookIt from MotorCity Apps? They're local so want to support but the reviews are mixed

**Comments:**
- "I know Dana, she's great. Haven't tried the product."
- "Downloaded it but couldn't figure out the setup."
- "Using Square Appointments, happy with it"
- "My friend uses it for her massage business, says it's okay but slow on mobile"

**"Hair Salon Business Tips" Group** - Dec 12, 2024

> Do NOT recommend BookIt for salons. No buffer time, no rebooking reminders, complicated setup. Spent $29 for a month and canceled. Acuity or Vagaro are much better for our industry.

## My Take (Aaliyah)

Our social presence is non-existent and our word-of-mouth is turning negative. The product issues are becoming our brand. We need to:

1. Fix the actual product problems (I can't market my way out of a broken mobile app)
2. Find and nurture happy users (they exist! mostly solopreneurs)
3. Stop trying to look enterprise—it's backfiring
4. Consider vertical-specific positioning (salons keep coming up)

I've said all this before. Nobody listens.
