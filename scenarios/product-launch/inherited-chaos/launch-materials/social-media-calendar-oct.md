## Post-Launch Reality Check

### What worked:
- Launch day got decent engagement
- Local Detroit angle resonated
- Tutorial content performed okay

### What didn't work:
- Enterprise content fell flat
- Couldn't maintain posting cadence after week 2 (too busy with support)
- No user-generated content—couldn't find happy users to feature
- Engagement dropped sharply after launch week

### Metrics (October total):
- Twitter followers gained: 47
- LinkedIn followers gained: 23
- Instagram followers gained: 12
- Direct signups from social: ~40 (estimated via UTM)

### Problems:
1. **I'm one person doing all marketing.** Social media, email, website, press, partnerships—I can't do it all.
2. **No content pipeline.** I'm creating everything day-of.
3. **Mixed messaging.** Are we for solopreneurs or enterprise? My social content reflects our overall confusion.
4. **Can't showcase users.** Hard to do social proof when users are complaining.

### What I stopped doing:
- Instagram (after week 2)
- LinkedIn company page (sporadic at best)
- Consistent posting schedule (when support emergencies took over)

## November-December Status

Basically abandoned the social calendar. I'm handling customer complaints via DM, helping Carmen with support, and trying to save accounts from churning.

We need:
1. Another marketing person (or at least a part-time social manager)
2. Clear brand positioning so I know what to post
3. Happy customers I can feature
4. A product that doesn't generate constant complaints

Until then, social media is survival mode.
