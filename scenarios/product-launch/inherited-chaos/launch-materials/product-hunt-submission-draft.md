# Product Hunt Launch - DRAFT

## Why I'm not recommending we do Product Hunt

I drafted this submission, but I don't think we should launch on Product Hunt right now. Here's why:

1. **Product isn't ready.** Mobile app is slow, onboarding is confusing, we're missing key features. PH users are ruthless—they'll call us out.

2. **We don't know our positioning.** "Scheduling for everyone" won't stand out. PH rewards specific, novel products.

3. **Can't handle the traffic.** If we get featured, we'll get thousands of visitors. Our support is one person. Our servers haven't been load-tested properly.

4. **Negative reviews are permanent.** A bad PH launch follows you forever. Better to wait until we're ready.

My recommendation: Launch on PH in Q1 2025 after we fix the core issues. But Dana wants to do it at launch, so here's the draft.

## Product Hunt Submission

### Tagline (60 characters max)
**Simple scheduling for service businesses, built in Detroit**

Alternative options:
- "Book more appointments. Cancel fewer headaches."
- "The scheduling app that grows with your business"
- "Your calendar, automated. Your time, reclaimed."

### Description (260 characters max)
BookIt helps service businesses manage appointments without the headache. Online booking, calendar sync, automatic reminders, and team scheduling—all in one place. Built by a small team in Detroit who think scheduling should be simple.

### What is BookIt?

BookIt is a scheduling platform designed for service-based businesses—think consultants, salons, fitness trainers, and therapists. We built it because existing solutions are either too simple (Calendly) or too complex (Acuity/Vagaro).

**Key features:**
- Beautiful, customizable booking pages
- Automatic sync with Google Calendar and Outlook
- Email and SMS reminders
- Stripe and Square payment integration
- Multi-staff scheduling
- Mobile apps for iOS and Android

**What makes us different:**
[THIS IS WHERE I STRUGGLED. What IS different about us?]

Option A: "We're focused on service businesses, not just meetings"
- Problem: So is Acuity

Option B: "We're simpler than Acuity but more powerful than Calendly"
- Problem: We're actually not simpler than Acuity right now

Option C: "Built in Detroit by people who care"
- Problem: Vague, emotional, not a feature

Option D: "Modern design, affordable pricing"
- Problem: Subjective and weak

Honestly? I don't have a compelling differentiator to put here. That's a problem.

### First Comment (from maker)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Dana/Marcus], and I'm excited to share BookIt with you.

We built BookIt because we saw our friends running small businesses struggle with scheduling. They were drowning in phone calls, text messages, and sticky notes. The existing tools were either too basic or required a PhD to set up.

BookIt is our answer: powerful enough for growing businesses, simple enough for anyone.

We're a small team (14 people!) based in Detroit, and we've poured our hearts into this. We'd love your feedback.

A few things we're especially proud of:
- Setup takes less than 10 minutes [NOTE: This is aspirational, not true]
- Our mobile apps are actually fast [NOTE: Also not true]
- You can collect payments at booking with zero technical setup

And a few things we know we need to work on:
- [We should acknowledge weaknesses but idk what to say here]

Happy to answer any questions!

### Planned Responses to Likely Comments

**"How is this different from Calendly?"**
Calendly is great for simple meeting scheduling. BookIt is built for ongoing service businesses—think salons, fitness trainers, consultants with regular clients. We have features like [buffer time? we don't have it], [service catalogs, recurring appointments, etc.].

**"What about Acuity?"**
Acuity has been around for 18 years and has tons of features. We're building a modern alternative that's easier to set up and use. Think of us as the "fresh start" option.

**"Why should I switch?"**
If you're happy with your current tool, you probably shouldn't! But if you're frustrated with complexity or looking for something newer, give us a try.

**"Is this for enterprise?"**
We do have enterprise features (SSO, API) but honestly, we're best for small-to-medium businesses right now. If you're a Fortune 500, we're probably not your best bet yet.

## My Final Recommendation

Don't do this. Not now.

We'll get torn apart. The product has real issues that sophisticated PH users will find immediately. A mediocre launch (or worse, a bad one) will hurt us more than skipping it.

Wait until:
1. Mobile app is fixed
2. Onboarding is streamlined
3. We have 3-5 strong testimonials
4. We have a clear differentiator

Then come back and crush it.

*P.S. Dana overruled me on this, but then we ran out of time to actually do the launch. So it never happened. Probably for the best.*
