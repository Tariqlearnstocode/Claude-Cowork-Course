**NOTES:**
- 42% open rate is good
- 8% click rate is okay
- 23 conversions from 847 recipients is... not great

Several people replied asking what makes us different from Calendly. I didn't have a good answer.

Best,
The BookIt Team

---

**NOTES:**
- Open rate dropped from email 1
- Very low conversions
- Several unsubscribes after this email
- One reply: "I'm a solo consultant. Why are you emailing me about teams?"

Lesson: We're emailing the same list with different messages. Confusing.

## Email 3: Enterprise Announcement (SENT - MISTAKE)

**Subject:** Introducing BookIt Enterprise

**Sent:** October 29, 2024
**Open rate:** 24%
**Click rate:** 2%
**Conversions:** 0

---

Hi [First Name],

Big news: BookIt now offers enterprise-grade features for larger organizations.

**BookIt Enterprise includes:**
- Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML

Best,
The BookIt Team

---

**NOTES:**
- This was Dana's idea. I disagreed.
- Our list is 90% solopreneurs and small businesses
- 0 conversions
- 12 unsubscribes
- Replies included: "I'm one person, why would I need enterprise?" and "Is this the right email list?"

I should have pushed back harder. This email hurt our relationship with our actual users.

## Email 4: Case Study (DRAFTED - NEVER SENT)

**Subject:** How [Business Name] books 40% more appointments with BookIt

**Status:** ABANDONED - We didn't have a case study ready

---

Hi [First Name],

[CASE STUDY CONTENT]

We were going to feature Hair Haven Salon but they were frustrated about the buffer time issue and declined.

Then we tried to get Yoga With Yolanda but she was having issues with the mobile app.

Then we tried a fitness studio but they said the group class feature wasn't working for them.

We couldn't find a happy customer willing to go on record.

That should tell you something.

---

## Email 5: "We're listening" (DRAFTED - NEVER SENT)

**Subject:** We heard you. Here's what we're fixing.

**Status:** DRAFTED but never approved

---

Hi [First Name],

We launched BookIt three weeks ago, and we've been listening to your feedback. A lot.

You told us:
- The mobile app is too slow
- Setup takes too long
- You want buffer time between appointments
- Some features are confusing

We hear you. Here's what we're doing:

1. **Mobile performance:** Our team is working on a major update (target: November)
2. **Simpler onboarding:** New setup wizard coming soon
3. **Buffer time:** In development, launching in December
4. **Clearer UI:** We're simplifying the settings

We're a small team and we're committed to getting this right. Thank you for your patience.

If you have specific feedback, hit reply—I read every email.

Aaliyah
Head of Marketing, MotorCity Apps

**NOTES:**
- I drafted this after seeing the support tickets
- Marcus loved it
- Dana said "we can't admit we have problems publicly, it will hurt trust"
- I argued that acknowledging problems and fixing them BUILDS trust
- Email was never sent
- I still think we should have sent it

**Subject:** 50% off BookIt - Black Friday only

**Sent:** November 29, 2024

---

## Email Campaign Summary

| Email | Sent | Opens | Clicks | Conversions |
|-------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Launch | 847 | 42% | 8% | 23 |
| Team Features | 847 | 31% | 4% | 7 |
| Enterprise | 847 | 24% | 2% | 0 |
| Black Friday | 792 | 38% | 11% | 34 |

**Total email-attributed signups:** 64
**Total email-attributed revenue:** ~$2,800 (discounted)

**Problems:**
- No segmentation—everyone gets the same emails
- Inconsistent messaging—are we for solos or enterprise?
- No nurture sequence for different use cases
- Can't do case studies because we don't have happy customers

**What I'd do differently:**
1. Segment by business type and size
2. Pick ONE message and stick to it
3. Send the "we're listening" email
4. Focus on helping users succeed, not selling features
