## Hero Section

### Headline
**Scheduling made simple. Growth made possible.**

[NOTE: Dana wanted "Enterprise-grade scheduling for modern businesses." I fought for this version. It's still not great but at least it's not aggressively wrong.]

### Subhead
The all-in-one appointment scheduling platform for businesses of every size.

[NOTE: "Every size" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. We wanted to not exclude anyone. Result: we appeal to no one specifically.]

### CTA Buttons
- **Start Free Trial** (primary)
- **See Pricing** (secondary)

## Features Section

### Section Header
**Everything you need to manage your schedule**

[This is the most generic possible headline. I know. I submitted 15 alternatives. This was the "safe" choice.]

### Feature 1: Online Booking
**Let clients book 24/7**
Your personalized booking page works while you sleep. Clients pick their time, you show up.

### Feature 2: Smart Reminders
**Reduce no-shows by 70%**
Automatic email and SMS reminders keep everyone on the same page.

[NOTE: The 70% stat is from a Calendly study. Not sure if we can claim it.]

### Feature 3: Calendar Sync
**One calendar to rule them all**
BookIt syncs with Google Calendar, Outlook, and more. No more double-booking.

### Feature 4: Payment Integration
**Get paid upfront**
Collect deposits or full payments when clients book. Stripe and Square supported.

### Feature 5: Team Management
**Scale with your business**
Add staff, set permissions, manage multiple calendars from one dashboard.

### Feature 6: Enterprise Ready
**Security that scales**
SSO integration, API access, and dedicated support for larger organizations.

[MARCUS NOTE (Oct 2): "Why is this even here? Our enterprise features are half-baked."
AALIYAH RESPONSE: "Dana insisted."
MARCUS: "This is going to hurt us."]

## Social Proof Section

### Header
**Trusted by growing businesses**

[NOTE: We didn't have many testimonials at launch. These are the ones we had:]

> "BookIt saved me hours every week on scheduling."
> — Sarah M., Consultant

> "Finally, a scheduling tool that doesn't require a PhD to set up."
> — Mike T., Personal Trainer

> "The team features are exactly what we needed."
> — Jennifer K., Salon Owner

[NOTE: These are real quotes from beta users, but they're also the ONLY positive quotes we had. We didn't include any company names or photos because most users didn't want to be publicly named. That should have been a red flag.]

## Pricing Section

[Pricing table was separate. See pricing-page-copy.md]

---

## Final CTA

### Header
**Ready to take control of your schedule?**

### Subhead
Join thousands of businesses who trust BookIt.

[CONFESSION: We had like 400 beta users at launch. "Thousands" was aspirational. Maybe a mistake to claim this.]

### Button
**Start Your Free Trial**

## POST-LAUNCH REFLECTION (December 2024)

I'm adding this because someone will eventually read this file.

### What went wrong with this copy:

1. **No clear target audience.** We said "businesses of every size" because we couldn't decide. Translation: this product is for no one in particular.

2. **Feature-first, not benefit-first.** We listed what BookIt does, not why someone should care.

3. **Enterprise features prominently displayed.** Our Team and Solo users don't care about SSO. Enterprise visitors who do care realize our features are immature.

4. **Weak social proof.** Three anonymous quotes with no faces, no company names, no credibility signals.

5. **Generic everything.** This could be the homepage for any scheduling app. What makes BookIt BookIt?

### What I would do differently:

1. **Pick a specific target.** "The scheduling app for beauty and wellness professionals" or "Simple scheduling for solopreneurs"

2. **Lead with the pain.** "Stop playing phone tag. Stop double-booking. Stop losing clients."

3. **Show real businesses.** Photos, names, stories. "How Hair Haven Salon reduced no-shows by 40%"

4. **Hide enterprise stuff.** It's not ready and it confuses our actual market.

5. **Be specific about what we're good at.** If we're good for solo consultants, SAY THAT. Own it.

I've suggested all of this. The response is always "we don't want to limit ourselves." But by not limiting ourselves, we've limited our appeal to zero.
