[TODO: Get actual feature list from product team]
[TODO: Decide on what to emphasize]

BookIt offers flexible pricing starting at $12/month for individuals [VERIFY], with team plans available for growing businesses. Enterprise pricing is available upon request.

[NOTE: Enterprise pricing wasn't finalized when I wrote this. Did we ever finalize it?]

## INTERNAL NOTES (DO NOT PUBLISH)

### Issues with this draft:

1. **We can't agree on target market.** Dana wants enterprise language, Marcus wants SMB language. I've tried to write something that works for both and it works for neither.

2. **Feature emphasis is all over the place.** Are we highlighting simplicity or enterprise features? They're opposite positioning.

3. **The quote from Dana is generic.** Every scheduling app says this.

4. **No differentiation.** Why would press care? What's the story? "Detroit company launches scheduling app" is not a story.

5. **I don't know our actual pricing.** The tiers keep changing.

### What I actually wanted to write:

**Angle 1: Local story**
"Detroit startup takes on Calendly, builds scheduling app with local businesses in mind"

**Angle 2: Founder story**
"Former automotive engineers pivot to consumer software, launch BookIt to help service businesses manage their time"

**Angle 3: Underdog story**
"David vs. Goliath: Small Detroit team builds alternative to VC-backed scheduling giants"

Any of these would be more interesting than what we have. But nobody would approve them because they require us to have a clear identity.

### Recommendation:

Don't send this press release. It's not ready. The product positioning needs to be decided first.

*P.S. I sent this feedback to Marcus on Oct 8. He said "I'll talk to Dana." Then launch happened anyway. This press release was never sent, which is probably for the best.*
