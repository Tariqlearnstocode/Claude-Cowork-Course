# Handoff Notes

*Marcus Chen - Last day is Friday the 13th (lol fitting)*

Hey, whoever's reading this. Sorry this isn't more organized. I found out I got the job at Notion on Tuesday and they wanted me to start in two weeks, so this is what I could pull together.

## Current State

BookIt launched Oct 15. Numbers aren't great. Dana is stressed. Jerome is frustrated. Everyone's pointing fingers.

The honest truth? We tried to do too much. I said this in multiple meetings but got overruled. Look at the meeting notes from August—I'm on record saying we should push enterprise features to v2.

## Things I Was Working On

### Q1 Relaunch Planning
Started a doc but didn't finish. The basic idea: strip back to core features, focus on a specific market segment. I was thinking salons specifically—they were our best early adopters.

### User Research
Carmen has been collecting feedback. There's gold in there. I kept asking for time to do proper user interviews but we were always "too busy shipping."

### Enterprise Pivot Evaluation
Dana wanted me to figure out how to make enterprise work. I don't think it will. The product isn't ready, we don't have the sales team, and enterprises have different needs. But she really wants it. Maybe you'll have better luck convincing her.

## Key Files

- Feature requests are in a CSV somewhere. Warning: lots of contradictions.
- Competitor analysis folder has some stuff Aaliyah's intern put together. Mixed quality.
- There's meeting notes but they're scattered. I tried to keep them in one folder but people kept making their own copies.

## Things Nobody Wants to Talk About

1. **The launch date was arbitrary.** Dana picked Oct 15 because she had a podcast interview scheduled. We weren't ready.

2. **The enterprise features were Jerome's baby.** He built the SSO and API stuff because it was technically interesting. Nobody asked for it.

3. **We never actually validated the market.** We assumed people wanted what we were building.

4. **Pete is burned out.** He's been working 60+ hour weeks since June. If he quits, you're in serious trouble.

5. **Aaliyah has good instincts but keeps getting overruled.** She wanted to focus on local Detroit businesses first. That was probably right.

## My Honest Take

You want to know what went wrong? We tried to be Calendly + Acuity + HubSpot all at once. We built enterprise features nobody wanted while ignoring basic stuff that would've helped our actual users.

The product is fine for solopreneurs and tiny businesses. It's NOT ready for teams of 10+. It's DEFINITELY not ready for enterprise.

If I were staying, I'd:
1. Kill the enterprise tier
2. Focus exclusively on solo/small team users
3. Fix the onboarding (it's confusing as hell)
4. Make the mobile app not suck
5. Double down on salons and fitness trainers—they were actually excited about us

But I'm not staying. So good luck. Sorry. Reach out if you have questions, I guess? marcus.chen.pm@gmail.com

## Passwords & Access

Everything should be in 1Password under "BookIt - Operations"

Admin access is through the main dashboard. Ask Jerome for credentials if they're not in 1Password.

## P.S.

Carmen is the only one who really understands what users want. Talk to her. She's been asking for someone to listen for months.

Also, the competitor analysis has a file called "what-theyre-doing-right.md" - I was going to use that for the relaunch plan. Still think it's relevant.

Sorry again for the mess. This job was... a lot.
