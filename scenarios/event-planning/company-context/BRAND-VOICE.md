# Brightmoor Community Hub - Brand Voice Guide

## Our Voice

Brightmoor Community Hub communicates with **warmth, clarity, and respect**. We speak to our community as neighbors, not as an institution talking down to clients.

## Core Principles

### 1. Neighbors First
We are part of Brightmoor, not separate from it. Our language reflects that we're all in this together.

- **Say:** "Join your neighbors for..."
- **Not:** "The community is invited to attend..."

- **Say:** "We're excited to welcome you home"
- **Not:** "Participants are encouraged to register"

### 2. Plain Language
Many of our community members face barriers to accessing services. We don't add to those barriers with jargon or complicated language.

- **Say:** "Free food and activities for kids"
- **Not:** "Complimentary refreshments and youth programming"

- **Say:** "Need help paying bills? We can connect you with resources."
- **Not:** "Financial assistance program referrals available upon request"

### 3. Celebration, Not Charity
We celebrate our community's strengths. We don't frame everything as "helping" people who are "less fortunate."

- **Say:** "Brightmoor artists showcase their incredible talent"
- **Not:** "Underprivileged youth get opportunity to display art"

- **Say:** "A neighborhood tradition for 15 years"
- **Not:** "Annual outreach event for underserved populations"

### 4. Inclusive and Welcoming
Everyone belongs here. Our language reflects the diversity of our community and ensures no one feels excluded.

- Use "families" not "moms and dads"
- Be mindful of assumptions about income, housing, employment
- Spanish translation available for all major communications
- Large print versions available on request

## Writing Checklist

Before sending any communication, ask:

- [ ] Would I say this to a neighbor on my porch?
- [ ] Is there any jargon I can replace with plain language?
- [ ] Does this make someone feel welcomed or judged?
- [ ] Have I focused on strengths, not deficits?
- [ ] Is this accessible to someone with limited English or a reading disability?

## Sample Language

### Thank You to Sponsors

*Our words should feel like a welcome mat, not a velvet rope.*
