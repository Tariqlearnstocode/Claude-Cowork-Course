# Event Planning Chaos: Brightmoor Community Hub

## Your Role

You are the newly hired **Community Programs Coordinator** at Brightmoor Community Hub in Detroit, Michigan. You started on Monday, June 3rd. Today is Wednesday, June 5th.

## The Situation

The previous coordinator, Marcus Chen, quit abruptly on Friday, May 31st - just three weeks before the annual Brightmoor Summer Festival scheduled for **Saturday, June 22nd**.

Marcus left no transition notes, didn't finish his exit paperwork, and isn't responding to calls or emails. His departure email simply said "I can't do this anymore. Best of luck with the festival."

Your executive director, Patricia Williams, is panicking. She's handed you Marcus's laptop and a box of folders, saying: "Figure out where we stand. The board meets Friday morning and they need answers."

## What You've Inherited

- A laptop with scattered files, half-finished documents, and a cluttered desktop
- Email threads mid-conversation with vendors and sponsors
- Budget spreadsheets that Patricia says "looked fine last month but now something seems off"
- Vendor contracts in various states of completion
- Sponsor agreements that may or may not be finalized

## Your Immediate Tasks

1. **Understand the current state** - What's actually confirmed? What's still pending?
2. **Identify the problems** - What's broken? What's missing? What's at risk?
3. **Find the budget reality** - Patricia suspects something is wrong with the numbers
4. **Prepare a status report** - The board needs clear answers by Friday

## What You Know

- The festival has happened every year for 15 years
- It typically draws 2,000-3,000 community members
- It's the Hub's biggest annual fundraiser and community engagement event
- Sponsors and community partners are counting on this event
- The Hub's reputation is on the line

## The Stakes

Brightmoor is an underserved neighborhood that has faced decades of disinvestment. The Community Hub is a lifeline - offering after-school programs, senior services, job training, and community gathering space. The Summer Festival isn't just an event; it's a symbol of community resilience and pride.

Canceling or significantly scaling back the festival would damage community trust, hurt sponsor relationships, and impact the Hub's funding for the coming year.

**You need to save this event.**

## Key Contacts

- **Patricia Williams** - Executive Director (your boss)
- **Darnell Thompson** - Facilities Manager (knows the building inside-out)
- **Maria Santos** - Volunteer Coordinator (manages 50+ regular volunteers)
- **Board of Directors** - Meets Friday, 9 AM

## A Note on Marcus

People at the Hub seem reluctant to talk about Marcus. The sense you get is that he was well-liked at first, enthusiastic and full of ideas, but became increasingly stressed and uncommunicative over the past few months. No one seems to know exactly what happened.
