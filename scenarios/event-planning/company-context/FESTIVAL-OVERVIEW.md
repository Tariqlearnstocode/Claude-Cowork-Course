## History and Significance

The first Brightmoor Summer Festival was held in 2009, organized by a coalition of neighbors who wanted to counter the narrative that Brightmoor was "just" a blighted, dangerous neighborhood. That first year, about 300 people attended a modest cookout with a borrowed speaker system.

The festival has grown every year, even through the city's bankruptcy and the COVID years (when it became a "Festival in a Box" drive-through event). It's become a symbol of Brightmoor's resilience.

For many families, it's one of the few times all year they can enjoy a full day of entertainment without worrying about costs. For the Hub, it's our most visible demonstration of what community investment can create.

## Budget Context

The festival typically costs $15,000 - $18,000 to produce, covered by:
- Corporate and business sponsorships (60%)
- Individual donations (15%)
- In-kind donations (15%)
- Hub general fund (10%)

**This year's approved budget:** $16,500

The festival is not primarily a fundraiser - any revenue from vendor fees or merchandise goes back into covering costs. The "return" is community engagement, visibility, and relationship-building with sponsors who support the Hub year-round.

## Key Partnerships

### Major Sponsors (Historically)
- Detroit Credit Union (presenting sponsor for 5 years)
- Brightmoor Hardware
- Various local businesses

### Community Partners
- Brightmoor Alliance
- Detroit Police 8th Precinct (community policing, safety)
- Detroit Fire Department (safety, kids' activities)
- Redford Union Schools
- Local churches and faith organizations

### In-Kind Partners
- Sound equipment (various sources over the years)
- Portable toilets, waste management
- Printing and signage

## What Makes It Work

1. **Volunteers** - 75-100 volunteers make the day possible
2. **Planning** - Usually a 4-month planning cycle (March - June)
3. **Relationships** - Long-standing vendor and sponsor relationships
4. **Community ownership** - Neighbors see this as *their* festival, not just a Hub event

## What Could Kill It

- Sponsor fallout - if a major sponsor pulls out late, there's no time to replace them
- Weather - no rain date; bad weather means lower turnout
- Safety incident - anything that makes families feel unsafe
- Logistical failure - no power, no food, no entertainment
- Bad community relations - if people feel the Hub isn't listening or serving them
