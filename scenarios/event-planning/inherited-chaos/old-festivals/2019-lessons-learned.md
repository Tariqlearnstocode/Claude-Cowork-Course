# 2019 Festival - LESSONS LEARNED (THE RAIN YEAR)

## What Happened

It rained. Hard. Starting at 2pm and continuing until 5pm.

We had no rain plan. At all.

## Timeline of Disaster

- **12:00pm** - Festival starts, overcast but dry
- **1:30pm** - Weather radar shows storm coming, ignored it
- **2:15pm** - Rain starts, light at first
- **2:30pm** - Heavy downpour begins
- **2:45pm** - Main stage electronics shut down for safety
- **3:00pm** - Attendance drops from ~1,500 to ~200 (people sheltering in cars/Hub)
- **3:30pm** - Food vendors packing up
- **4:00pm** - Bounce houses deflated (can't run in rain)
- **5:15pm** - Rain stops
- **5:30pm** - Attempt to restart, some success
- **6:30pm** - Headliner performs to ~400 people
- **8:00pm** - Wrap up

## Financial Impact

- Attendance: ~1,800 (down from 2,700 in 2018)
- Several sponsors questioned value
- Food vendors lost money, some haven't returned

## What We Should Have Done

1. **Watched the weather** - Storm was predictable 24 hours out
2. **Had a communication plan** - No way to tell attendees what was happening
3. **Protected electronics** - Nearly fried the sound board
4. **Had indoor backup space** - Hub can hold 200, should have had programming ready
5. **Covered critical equipment** - Lost $300 in decorations/supplies to water damage

## What We Did Right

1. Kept calm (mostly)
2. Opened Hub building for shelter
3. Headliner stayed and performed
4. Volunteers were troopers

## Rain Plan for Future

1. **Monitor weather starting 3 days out**
2. **If >50% chance of rain:**
   - Alert volunteers
   - Prep indoor backup activities
   - Have tarps ready for equipment
   - Brief all vendors on contingency
3. **If rain starts:**
   - Immediately cover all electronics
   - Move people to shelter (Hub, tents)
   - Activate indoor programming
   - Keep food service going if possible
   - Regular announcements about status
4. **Communication:**
   - PA announcements every 15 minutes during weather
   - Social media updates
   - Text alert to volunteer list
5. **Go/No-Go decision:**
   - Patricia makes final call
   - If lightning, shut down immediately
   - If just rain, try to wait it out

## Equipment Protection

- Tarps for stage electronics: $150
- Waterproof bins for supplies: $100
- Backup generator with cover: $300 rental
- Total: $550 (worth it)
