## Attendance Metrics

- Food distribution count: 2,847 meals served
- Kids Zone participants: ~600
- Health screenings: 234
- Volunteer hours: 412 (54 volunteers)

## Highlights

1. **New partnership with Henry Ford Health** - Free health screenings were incredibly popular
2. **Gospel Choir of Detroit** headlined - Great energy, positive feedback
3. **Expanded kids zone** - Added second bounce house, well-received
4. **Smoothest setup ever** - Started at 7am, ready by 11:30am

## Challenges

1. **Volunteer no-shows** - 15 volunteers didn't show up, scrambled to cover
2. **Generator issues** - Power went out in food area for 30 minutes
3. **Parking overflow** - Needed to use street parking earlier than expected
4. **Sound quality** - Complaints about volume and clarity from back of crowd

## Lessons Learned

1. Overbook volunteers by 20% to account for no-shows
2. Have backup generator on standby
3. Coordinate with neighbors about street parking BEFORE event
4. Invest in better sound system or position speakers differently
5. Start security earlier - got crowded faster than expected

## Sponsor Feedback

- **Detroit Credit Union (Linda Chen):** "Another great year! We love the visibility and community connection. Count us in for 2024."
- **Brightmoor Hardware (Earl Patterson):** "Best one yet. Keep doing what you're doing."

## Recommendations for 2024

1. **Budget increase:** Request $16,500 to improve sound/entertainment quality
2. **Earlier planning:** Start sponsor outreach in February
3. **Bigger headliner:** Community requests for more recognized entertainment
4. **Expanded health fair:** Henry Ford willing to do more if we provide space
5. **Rain contingency:** Need actual plan, not just hope
