# 2022 Festival Recap - Quick Notes

*Sarah's working notes*

## The Good

- Weather perfect
- Sound system worked great (used Darnell's guy - Tony something)
- DCU happy with their booth location
- Health fair was new this year and HUGE hit
- Pastor Williams's prayer was lovely

## The Bad

- Bounce house company was 2 hours late
- T-shirts ran out by 3pm (ordered 200, needed 300)
- Not enough shade - several heat complaints
- One food vendor ran out of food at 4pm

## The Ugly

- Lost power in main stage at 5pm for 45 minutes
- Missed permits deadline, had to pay rush fee
- Headliner (local DJ) was disappointing, low energy
- Argument between two vendors about booth placement

## Numbers

- Attendance: ~2,500 (down from 2021)
- Budget: $9,800 spent of $10,000 approved
- Volunteers: 48 (needed 60)

## Lessons

1. ORDER MORE SHIRTS
2. Need better headliner - worth spending more
3. Add tents for shade
4. Confirm permits 6 weeks out minimum
5. Power backup is critical

## Sponsor Notes

- DCU renewed immediately - Linda is great
- Lost Fantastic Sam's (closed location)
- Gained QuickStop - small but appreciated
- Mr. Patterson (hardware) asked about logo on shirts - not possible this year but consider for next

## Random

- Cost of bounce houses: $650 (Jumpin' Jacks)
- Sound system: $750 (borrowed amp broke, had to rent replacement)
- Porta potties: $500 (3 units)
