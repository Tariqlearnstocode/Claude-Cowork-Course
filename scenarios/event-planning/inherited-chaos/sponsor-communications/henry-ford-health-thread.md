**Subject:** Summer Festival Health Fair - Confirming Partnership

Hi Marcus,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out early to confirm Henry Ford Health's participation in the Brightmoor Summer Festival health fair again this year.

We're planning to offer:
- Free blood pressure screenings
- Blood glucose checks
- BMI assessments
- Health education materials
- Information about our community programs
- Giveaways (water bottles, hand sanitizer, etc.)

We'll bring our mobile health unit and staff it with 2 nurses and 2 health educators from 12pm-6pm.

This is all at no cost to the Hub, of course - it's part of our community health mission.

A few questions:
1. Same location as last year? Near the main entrance?
2. Do we have access to electrical?
3. Can you remind me of the setup/breakdown times?

Looking forward to another great partnership!

Stephanie!

This is wonderful - thank you so much! The health fair is always one of the most valuable parts of the festival. Last year we had over 200 people get screened!

To answer your questions:
1. Yes, same location - right near the main entrance under the big tent
2. Yes, we'll have power run to your area
3. Setup starts at 9am, festival ends at 8pm but you can break down anytime after 6pm

I'll send over a formal site map and logistics packet closer to the date.

Thank you again for everything Henry Ford does for our community!

Marcus

Hi Marcus,

Just checking in as we're about a month out! A few updates from our side:

1. We can now also offer free COVID/flu combo vaccines if you want them. Need to confirm by May 31st so we can coordinate with our pharmacy team.

2. Our mobile unit has some new equipment - can you confirm we'll have at least 20 amps of power available?

3. Still waiting on that site map and logistics packet you mentioned.

Let me know!

Stephanie,

Thank you for the vaccines offer - YES please! That would be amazing. I'll confirm officially by the 31st.

On the power - I need to check with our facilities manager. Will get back to you.

Site map coming soon, I promise!

**Subject:** URGENT: Need Confirmation Today

Hi Marcus,

Today is the deadline to confirm the vaccines. I've tried calling but keep getting voicemail.

Can you please confirm:
1. Yes or no on vaccines
2. Power availability (20 amps)
3. Any changes to our location or timing

I really need a response today or we won't be able to bring the vaccine team.

Patricia,

I heard through the grapevine that Marcus is no longer with the Hub. I hope everything is okay.

I need to confirm our health fair participation for June 22nd. We're still committed to coming, but I have outstanding questions:

1. We offered to bring free COVID/flu vaccines but never got confirmation - it's too late now, so we'll just do the regular screenings
2. We need 20 amps of power for our mobile unit - is this available?
3. I never received the site map or logistics packet

Please connect me with whoever is taking over festival coordination.

Thank you,
Stephanie Martinez
