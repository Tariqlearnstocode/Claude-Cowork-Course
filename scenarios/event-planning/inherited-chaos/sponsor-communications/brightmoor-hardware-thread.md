Mr. Patterson!

Hope you're doing well. Spring is here and that means it's almost festival season!

I wanted to reach out early this year to confirm that Brightmoor Hardware will be joining us again as a sponsor for the Summer Festival on June 22nd. You've been with us since the very first festival and we couldn't imagine doing it without you!

Same level as last year? $1,500 Silver Sponsor?

Let me know and I'll get the paperwork together.

Thanks!
Marcus

Marcus,

You know we're in. Been supporting the Hub since my daddy ran this store and I don't plan on stopping now.

$1,500 is good. Just tell me where to send the check and when you need it.

Also - my cousin Gloria wants to bring her ice cream truck to the festival. She's legit - has all the permits and everything. Can you make room for her?

Mr. Patterson,

You're the best! Thank you for your continued support. The Hub and the whole Brightmoor community are so lucky to have you.

I'll send over the sponsorship agreement next week. We'd like payment by June 1st if possible, but anytime before the festival is fine.

And YES - Gloria is absolutely welcome! I'll add Sweet Treats Ice Cream to our vendor list. We'll waive the vendor fee since you're family (and a sponsor!).

See you soon,
Marcus

Marcus,

Few things:

1. Gloria is all set for June 22. She'll arrive around 11am to set up. Where should she park the truck?

2. You mentioned putting our logo on the t-shirts this year. I'm flattered! What do you need from me - the logo file? What format?

3. Never got that sponsorship agreement. Not that I need it - my word is my word - but my accountant likes paper.

4. When do you need the $1,500? I can write a check whenever.

Let me know.

Earl

Mr. Patterson,

Thanks for the reminder on all this!

1. Gloria can set up in the food vendor area on the east side of the parking lot. I'll send a site map closer to the date.

2. Yes! We're putting sponsor logos on the back of the volunteer t-shirts. Can you send me your logo as a PNG or vector file (AI, EPS)? High resolution if possible.

3. Agreement attached! Sorry for the delay.

4. June 1st would be ideal if you can swing it, but anytime before the festival works.

Thank you again!
Marcus

Logo attached. Had my grandson dig it out of the computer.

Check will be in the mail this week.

See you at the festival!

**Subject:** Check?

Marcus,

Did you get my check? Mailed it two weeks ago. Want to make sure it didn't get lost.

Also tried calling the Hub yesterday but nobody picked up. Everything okay over there?
