Marcus,

Great news! I've gotten approval from our marketing committee for the $5,000 presenting sponsorship again this year. We love being part of the Brightmoor Summer Festival and are excited for year six of our partnership.

I do need a few things from you to finalize:

1. The sponsorship agreement (same as last year is fine, just update the date)
2. Confirmation of our benefits package (logo placement, booth location, speaking opportunity, etc.)
3. Deadline for getting you our logo files and banner content

Can you send those over by end of month? Our legal team needs 2 weeks to review before I can sign.

Looking forward to another great festival!

Best,
Linda Chen

Linda!

This is fantastic news - thank you so much! Patricia and the whole team are thrilled to have DCU back as our presenting sponsor.

I'll get that agreement over to you shortly. And yes, all the same benefits as last year:
- "Presented by Detroit Credit Union" on all materials
- Premium booth location near main stage
- Logo on banners, t-shirts, flyers, and social media
- 2-minute speaking slot during opening ceremony
- Recognition from stage throughout the day
- Post-event thank you in newsletter and annual report

One thing - we're hoping to add some exciting new elements this year that would give you even MORE visibility. I'm working on some ideas and will share soon!

Thanks again,
Marcus

Hi Marcus,

Just following up - I still haven't received the sponsorship agreement. My legal team is getting antsy and I need to get this wrapped up.

Also, you mentioned "exciting new elements" - I'm intrigued! What did you have in mind?

Let me know,
Linda

Linda,

So sorry for the delay! Agreement attached. Let me know if legal has any questions.

As for the new elements - I'm working on securing a MAJOR headliner act this year (can't say who yet but very exciting) and I was thinking DCU could be the exclusive sponsor of the main stage! "The Detroit Credit Union Main Stage" - your branding on the stage backdrop, your logo on the performer schedule, maybe even a DCU-branded photo backdrop for concert photos?

This would be in addition to everything else, no extra charge - just our way of saying thank you for five amazing years of partnership.

Thoughts?

Marcus

Marcus,

I LOVE the main stage naming idea! That's exactly the kind of visibility our marketing team gets excited about. Consider it a yes from me - I'll just need it added to the formal agreement.

Can you send a revised agreement with the "Detroit Credit Union Main Stage" naming rights included? I want to make sure it's documented.

Also - who's the headliner?! The suspense is killing me!

Marcus,

Haven't heard back about the revised agreement. Also, I mentioned this to my director and she's very excited about the main stage naming - she wants to know if we can do a press release about it.

Please advise. Getting a little concerned about timeline here.

**Subject:** URGENT: Sponsorship Agreement Status

Marcus,

I need an immediate response. The festival is ONE MONTH away and I still don't have:
- A signed sponsorship agreement
- Confirmation of the main stage naming rights
- Specs for logo placement on materials
- Deadline for our banner content

I've left you two voicemails this week. My director is asking me daily about this and I'm running out of ways to explain the delay.

I also saw on your Facebook page that you announced the Barnes Family as your headliner. That's great! But why am I hearing about this on social media instead of from you directly? You promised me exclusive information about the "major headliner."

I need the revised agreement with the main stage naming by END OF DAY FRIDAY or I'll have to escalate this to Patricia.

Linda

Linda,

I apologize for the communication gaps. Things have been hectic here.

I'm attaching the revised agreement now with the main stage naming included. You're right that I should have looped you in on the Barnes Family announcement - that was an oversight and I'm sorry.

Regarding the press release - I think that's a great idea. Can you draft something and send it over for Patricia's approval?

Logo deadline: June 7th
Banner content deadline: June 10th

Thank you for your patience. I promise the festival is going to be amazing.

Marcus,

There's a problem with the agreement you sent.

Section 4 still shows the old benefits package. It doesn't include ANYTHING about the main stage naming rights. No mention of "Detroit Credit Union Main Stage," no stage backdrop branding, no photo backdrop, nothing.

Did you send the wrong version? I need the REVISED agreement that includes everything we discussed.

Also, I'm looking at this more carefully now - the agreement is dated April 22 but you sent it on May 23. The "Agreement Term" section says the agreement is effective "upon signature by both parties" but there's no actual signature line for Brightmoor Community Hub.

I can't sign an incomplete, unsigned agreement. Please send me a corrected version TODAY.

Linda

**Subject:** Sponsorship Agreement - Need Executive Involvement

Patricia,

I'm reaching out directly because I've been unable to resolve some issues with Marcus regarding our presenting sponsorship.

Detroit Credit Union has proudly sponsored the Brightmoor Summer Festival for five years, and we're committed to continuing that partnership. However, we're now less than a month from the event and I still don't have a signed agreement that accurately reflects what we've been promised.

Specifically, Marcus committed (in writing, via email) to naming rights for the main stage - "The Detroit Credit Union Main Stage" - but this has not been added to the formal agreement despite multiple requests.

I understand you're all very busy with event planning, but I need this resolved this week. Our legal department will not release funds without a proper agreement in place.

Can we schedule a call?

Regards,
Linda Chen
