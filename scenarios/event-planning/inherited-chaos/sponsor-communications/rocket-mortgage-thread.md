Dear Derek,

I hope this email finds you well! My name is Marcus Chen and I'm the Community Programs Coordinator at Brightmoor Community Hub in Detroit.

I'm reaching out because I believe Rocket Mortgage and Brightmoor Community Hub share a commitment to strengthening Detroit neighborhoods. Our annual Summer Festival is the largest community gathering in the Brightmoor area, drawing 2,500-3,000 residents for a day of free entertainment, food, and connection.

This year's festival is Saturday, June 22nd, and we're seeking sponsors who want to make a real impact in Detroit communities. I've attached a sponsorship packet with various levels of support.

I noticed that Rocket Mortgage has been expanding its community investment work, and I think the Summer Festival would be a perfect fit. Would you have 15 minutes for a call to discuss?

Thank you for your time,
Marcus Chen
Community Programs Coordinator

Marcus,

Thanks for reaching out. I had a chance to review your sponsorship packet - the festival looks like a great community event.

We're always looking for ways to support Detroit neighborhoods, but our community investment budget is largely allocated for the year. That said, I might be able to find some funds in our Q2 discretionary budget.

What level of sponsorship are you hoping for? And what would that include specifically?

Derek,

Thank you so much for responding! I'm thrilled you're interested.

We have a few sponsorship levels available:

**Gold Sponsor - $3,500**
- Logo on all event signage and promotional materials
- Booth space at the festival
- Recognition from main stage
- Social media mentions and newsletter feature
- Post-event impact report

**Silver Sponsor - $2,000**
- Logo on event signage
- Booth space
- Social media mentions

**Bronze Sponsor - $1,000**
- Logo on signage
- Recognition in program

For Rocket Mortgage, I'd love to offer the Gold level. Given your brand recognition, this would be mutually beneficial - we'd feature you prominently and you'd be reaching thousands of Detroiters.

Honestly, if you could swing the $3,500, it would make a HUGE difference for us this year. We're trying to make this the biggest festival yet.

Let me know what you think!
Marcus

Marcus,

I've been working on this internally. $3,500 is a stretch but I might be able to make it work. Let me run it up the chain and I'll get back to you by mid-May.

In the meantime, can you send me:
1. Your organization's 501(c)(3) documentation
2. Last year's festival attendance numbers (verified if possible)
3. A breakdown of how sponsorship funds are used

Thanks,
Derek

Derek,

This is amazing news! Thank you for championing this internally.

Attached:
1. Our 501(c)(3) determination letter
2. Last year's attendance estimate: 2,847 (based on food distribution count and volunteer clicker data)
3. Budget breakdown for sponsorship funds (see attached)

Please let me know if you need anything else. We would be SO grateful to have Rocket Mortgage as part of this year's festival!

Hi Marcus,

I'm sorry to say that I wasn't able to secure the budget for this sponsorship. Our Q2 community funds have been redirected to our neighborhood revitalization initiative in Southwest Detroit.

I know this isn't the news you were hoping for. Please keep us in mind for next year - if you reach out earlier in our budget cycle (October-November), we may have more flexibility.

Wishing you a successful festival.

Best,
Derek

Derek,

Is there any chance of reconsideration? Even a smaller amount would help - $2,000? $1,500?

I understand budget constraints, but Brightmoor is exactly the kind of neighborhood that needs investment. Our residents would love to see Rocket Mortgage supporting their community.

Please let me know if there's anything I can do to make this work.

Marcus,

I understand the disappointment, but the decision is final for this year. Our budget is fully committed.

I'd encourage you to apply through our formal community grants process for 2025. You can find the application at rocketmortgage.com/community.

Best of luck with the festival.

Derek
