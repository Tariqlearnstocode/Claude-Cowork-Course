**Pauline:** Marcus honey I have a question. My daughter wants to do a pop-up nail station at the festival. Little kids nails, nothing fancy. Would that be okay? She wouldn't charge or anything just wants the practice

**May 18, 4:45 PM**
**Marcus:** That sounds lovely! Let me check on logistics and get back to you.
