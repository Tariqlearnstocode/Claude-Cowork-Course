# Rosedale Park Summer Fair - Research Notes

**Event:** Rosedale Park Civic Association Summer Fair
**Date:** Usually 3rd Saturday of July
**Location:** Rosedale Park neighborhood, Detroit
**Attendance:** ~1,500

## Overview

Long-running neighborhood fair, similar vibe to ours but smaller scale. Been happening since the 1990s. Strong emphasis on the historic nature of the neighborhood.

## What They Do Well

- **Local business focus** - Almost all vendors and sponsors are hyper-local (within 2-mile radius)
- **Historic home tour** - Unique element that draws people from outside the neighborhood
- **Alumni connection** - Lots of returning former residents who grew up there
- **Professional signage** - Their banners and materials look really polished

## What We Could Learn

- They do a "passport" system where kids get stamps for visiting different booths. Cute idea, encourages exploration.
- Live music schedule is printed on fans - practical and people keep them as souvenirs
- They have a dedicated "quiet zone" for seniors and people who need a break from the noise

## Budget (Estimated)

Based on their sponsorship packet (got a copy from a friend), they operate on about $12,000-15,000. Presenting sponsor is $2,500.

They seem to spend less on entertainment and more on infrastructure (better tents, real tables, nice signage).

## Sponsors

- Motor City Brewery (presenting)
- Various local businesses
- Rosedale Park Civic Association kicks in about $3,000 from dues

## Notes

- NOT really a competitor - different neighborhood, different weekend
- But they draw some Brightmoor residents who like the vibe
- Could potentially partner or cross-promote?
