# Dearborn Arab International Festival - Research Notes

*Marcus's notes from attending in 2023*

**Event:** Arab International Festival (now called "Dearborn Summer Festival")
**Date:** June (varies)
**Location:** Downtown Dearborn
**Attendance:** 200,000+ over multiple days

## Overview

WAY bigger than anything we do. Not really comparable but interesting to see what a large-scale festival looks like.

## What They Do Well

- **Multi-day format** - Spreads costs and attendance over 3-4 days
- **Food variety** - Dozens of food vendors, major draw
- **Major entertainment** - Big-name Arab artists headline
- **Strong cultural identity** - Clear theme, clear audience

## What We Could Learn

- Volunteer coordination is incredibly tight - color-coded shirts, walkie-talkies, clear zones
- Signage is EVERYWHERE - impossible to get lost
- Multiple "vibe zones" - loud concert area, family area, quiet tea garden, etc.
- Sponsor integration is seamless - sponsors feel like part of the event, not just logos on banners

## Budget

Apparently $500,000+ annually. Different universe.

## Sponsors

Mix of national Arab-American businesses and local Dearborn institutions.

## Notes

- Not a competitor (different city, different scale, different audience)
- But useful benchmark for professional event operations
- Could we visit during planning season and talk to their organizers?
- Mayor's office seems very involved - city support is a multiplier

## Random Observation

They charge for some things (certain food areas, VIP sections) but keep the main festival free. Interesting model.
