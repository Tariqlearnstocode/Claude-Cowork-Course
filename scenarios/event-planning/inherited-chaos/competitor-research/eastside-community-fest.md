# Eastside Community Festival - Research Notes

**Event:** Eastside Community Festival
**Date:** Usually 2nd Saturday of August
**Location:** Balduck Park, East Detroit
**Attendance:** ~2,000-2,500

## Overview

This is probably our closest comparison. Similar size, similar community focus, similar budget. They've been doing it for about 10 years.

## What They Do Well

- **School involvement** - Every local school has a presence, makes it feel like a true community event
- **Reunion vibe** - They explicitly market it as a "neighborhood reunion" - brings back former residents
- **Local talent only** - All entertainment is from the community, no outside acts
- **Food competition** - Local cooks compete for "Best BBQ" etc. - very popular

## What We Could Learn

- **Revenue idea:** They charge $1 for raffle tickets and give away donated prizes. Apparently raises $500-800.
- **Sponsor cultivation:** They host a "sponsor appreciation breakfast" in the spring. Builds relationships before asking for money.
- **They share resources** with other eastside organizations - might be worth connecting
- **Cleanup is handled** by a local job training program - win-win

## Budget

Their coordinator told me they run on about $14,000-16,000. Similar to us.

Breakdown:
- Sponsors: 50%
- City grant: 20%
- Donations: 15%
- Vendor fees: 10%
- Org contribution: 5%

THEY GET A CITY GRANT. Are we applying for those? Look into Detroit festivals grant program.

## Sponsors

- Local car dealership (presenting - $3,000)
- Churches
- Small businesses
- Henry Ford Health also sponsors them (interesting - we share a partner)

## Notes

- DIRECT COMPETITOR in some ways - same summer timing, similar audience
- Some Brightmoor residents probably attend both
- Worth building relationship with their coordinator - Jennifer something? Get name from Patricia
- They had a food poisoning incident 3 years ago that almost killed the festival. Lesson: vet food vendors carefully.
