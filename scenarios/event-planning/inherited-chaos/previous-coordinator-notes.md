# Marcus's Festival Notes

## random thoughts and to-dos

ok so the festival is june 22. that's like... 7 weeks away? no wait we're in may now so more like 4 weeks. need to get moving on this

### sponsors

talked to detroit credit union, they're IN for $5000 again as presenting sponsor. linda chen is the contact. she mentioned something about wanting more visibility this year, I told her we could do a bigger banner and maybe let them have a table. she seemed happy? need to follow up on the actual agreement tho

ALSO talked to quicken loans - sorry rocket mortgage now lol - and they might be interested!! would be huge. guy named derek said to send a proposal. sent him something last week, haven't heard back. could be another $3-4k if they bite

brightmoor hardware is good for $1500 i think. mr. patterson always comes through. pretty sure this is confirmed but should double check

OH and stephanie from henry ford health called about the health fair. they'll do the free screenings again. not a cash sponsor but huge value

### vendors

food trucks:
- big baby bbq - CONFIRMED, they did last year, they're in
- taqueria lupita - need to call back, talked to someone but got disconnected
- detroit soul food co - ??? did I reach out? can't remember
- coney place on fenkell - they said yes I think, or was that for something else

bounce houses - got a quote from fun times inflatables, $800 for 3 bounce houses. seems high? last year was cheaper but i can't find who we used

face painting - maria said her niece does face painting. should be free? follow up with maria

sound system - darnell said he knows a guy. need to nail this down, critical

stage?? do we rent one or do we own one? ask darnell

### entertainment

main stage lineup:
- 12pm: opening - pastor williams from new beginning church? or was it new hope? prayers and welcome
- 1pm: redford union HS jazz band - need to confirm with mr. patterson (different patterson, the band teacher)
- 2pm: ???
- 3pm: destiny's youth dance team - confirmed, talked to ms. alberta
- 4pm: open slot
- 5pm: community talent show (maria organizing?)
- 6pm: ???
- 7pm: headliner - the barnes family gospel singers??? this was patricia's idea, she was supposed to reach out

need like 3 more acts. maybe can get dj for the gaps? teen area needs dj anyway

### budget stuff

see spreadsheet, i THINK we're ok but the numbers are confusing. patricia approved $16,500 total

spent so far:
- deposit for bounce houses $200
- deposit for porta potties $150
- flyers from print shop $175
- ??? i know there was something else

sponsors committed:
- detroit credit union: $5000 (CONFIRMED... pretty sure)
- rocket mortgage: $3500 (fingers crossed!!)
- brightmoor hardware: $1500
- pauline's hair salon: $250
- quickstop gas station: $200
- others? need to check email

### random other stuff

- permits: did we apply? check with patricia
- insurance: should be covered under hub policy?? verify
- parking: can we use church lot across street again?
- signage: need sponsor banners, directional signs, schedule boards
- volunteers: maria has list
- rain plan: there is no rain plan lol. it won't rain. it never rains. (it rained in 2019)

### may 15 update

ok so rocket mortgage isn't happening. derek finally emailed back, they're focused on "other community initiatives" this year. whatever. we'll be fine

recalculated budget and we're good. tighter than I wanted but it works

linda from DCU is getting antsy, keeps asking about the sponsor package details. sent her SOMETHING but she had questions. need to respond. her emails are getting snippy

### may 22 update

bounce house place wants full payment by june 1. also they raised the price to $950 now?? something about fuel costs???

mr patterson (hardware store) wants to know if we can put his logo on the t-shirts. I said yes. do we have t-shirts? add to list

### may 28 update

i can't do this
everything is falling apart
linda is furious about something, i don't even understand what
the budget doesn't work, I've been moving numbers around but
the barnes family wants $2000 and patricia already told everyone they're headlining
we don't have a sound system
i've made promises I can't keep

i'm going to talk to patricia tomorrow. this is too much. someone else needs to take over
