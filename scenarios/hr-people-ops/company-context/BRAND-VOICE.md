# Woodward Ventures - Brand Voice Guide

*Last updated: September 2024 by Marketing Team*

## Our Voice

Woodward Ventures communicates with **clarity, confidence, and construction-industry credibility**. We're tech people who speak builder, not Silicon Valley jargon. We're serious about solving problems but don't take ourselves too seriously.

## Core Voice Attributes

### 1. Builder-Friendly
We speak the language of construction. No unnecessary tech-speak. Practical, direct communication.

**Do say:**
- "Your subs' schedules, one place"
- "Real-time updates from the job site"
- "Stop chasing paperwork"

**Don't say:**
- "Leverage synergies across your ecosystem"
- "AI-powered paradigm shift"
- "Disruptive innovation in the construction space"

### 2. Detroit Proud
We're a Detroit company building for hardworking people. We're authentic and grounded.

**Do say:**
- "Built in Detroit for builders everywhere"
- "We understand what it's like to manage a tight schedule"
- "From Motor City to your job site"

**Don't say:**
- "We're basically the Uber of construction management"
- "As a top-tier startup..."
- Anything that sounds like we're embarrassed to be in Detroit

### 3. Reliable Partner
We're not just software - we're a partner in your success. Dependable, responsive, accountable.

**Do say:**
- "Our support team picks up the phone"
- "If something's not working, we'll make it right"
- "Built by people who've managed job sites"

**Don't say:**
- "Our AI handles everything automatically"
- "Set it and forget it"
- Generic tech promises we can't keep

### 4. Growth-Minded
We're growing fast and helping our customers grow. Ambitious but humble.

**Do say:**
- "We're learning and improving every release"
- "What worked at 50 projects works at 500"
- "Growing with you"

**Don't say:**
- "Industry leader" (we're not, yet)
