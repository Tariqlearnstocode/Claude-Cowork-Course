# Scenario: HR/People Ops Crisis

## Your Role

You are **Jordan Rivera**, the newly hired HR Manager at **Woodward Ventures**, a growing B2B SaaS startup in Detroit's tech corridor. Today is your first day. The previous HR person, Kelly Ostrowski, left three weeks ago with only two days' notice, citing "burnout and a better opportunity."

She left behind her laptop, a jumbled shared drive, and one very urgent problem.

## The Crisis

The Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity (LEO) has scheduled a **compliance audit in 21 days**. They're reviewing I-9 documentation, wage and hour records, and workplace safety compliance. This is a routine audit triggered by your rapid growth from 12 to 47 employees in 18 months.

The problem: Kelly's files are a disaster. Employee records are scattered across multiple spreadsheets. Some I-9 forms are missing entirely. Onboarding varies wildly from employee to employee. Benefits enrollment is a mess. And you're not even sure everyone is classified correctly as exempt vs. non-exempt.

The CEO, Marcus Chen, pulled you aside this morning. "Kelly said everything was 'fine' whenever I asked. But I found out from our accountant that we might have some... issues. I need you to get us audit-ready. Whatever it takes."

It is not fine. It's barely functional.

## About Woodward Ventures

**Founded:** 2022
**Location:** 1401 Woodward Avenue, Suite 800, Detroit, MI 48226 (in the Gilbert-owned building boom area)
**Industry:** B2B SaaS - project management and contractor coordination for construction companies
**Annual Revenue:** ~$3.2M ARR (growing 40% YoY)
**Headcount:** 47 employees (was 12 when founded)

### Company History

Woodward Ventures was founded by Marcus Chen (CEO) and Priya Patel (CTO) in 2022. Marcus had spent 15 years in commercial construction management; Priya was a software engineer at Ford's autonomous vehicle division. They saw construction companies struggling with contractor coordination and built BuildFlow, a SaaS platform that's now used by over 200 construction firms in the Midwest.

The company was bootstrapped for the first year, then raised a $4M seed round from Detroit Venture Partners and Techstars in early 2024. They've grown rapidly since, adding developers, salespeople, and customer success reps. The rapid growth has strained their informal HR practices.

### Current Products

**BuildFlow Pro** - Core project management platform
- Contractor scheduling and coordination
- Document management and version control
- Real-time communication tools
- Mobile app for field workers
- Integration with QuickBooks, Procore, etc.

**BuildFlow Safety** (launched Q3 2025)

### Staff Structure

**Executive Team:**
- Marcus Chen, CEO & Co-Founder
- Priya Patel, CTO & Co-Founder
- David Kowalski, VP of Sales (joined March 2025)
- You (Jordan Rivera), HR Manager (Day 1!)

**Departments:**
- Engineering: 18 people (Priya manages directly)
- Sales & Marketing: 12 people (David manages)
- Customer Success: 8 people (reports to Marcus currently)
- Operations/Admin: 4 people (includes you, office manager, two admins)
- Finance: 2 people (fractional CFO + accountant)

**Key People You'll Be Working With:**

**Priya Patel, CTO** - Brilliant but blunt. Hates "HR bureaucracy" but her team has had the most turnover. She'll push back on anything she sees as slowing down engineering.

**David Kowalski, VP Sales** - Came from a big company, expects proper HR. Has been complaining about the chaos since he arrived. Might be an ally.

**Aaliyah Washington, Office Manager** - Has been here since the beginning. Knows where everything is (sort of). Kelly relied on her for a lot. Overwhelmed but will help you.

**Marcus Chen, CEO** - Founder-mode mentality. Approachable but distracted by growth, customers, fundraising. Wants HR to "just work" without needing his involvement.

## Your Resources

Kelly's laptop and shared drive access. It's a mess. Files are in the `inherited-chaos/` folder - or at least the ones anyone could find. Aaliyah says there might be more in Kelly's personal Google Drive, but IT hasn't transferred access yet.

You also have:
- Access to the Gusto payroll system (Kelly set it up, documentation is sparse)
- A TriNet HRIS that was half-implemented and then abandoned
- A shared Google Drive with folders that haven't been organized since 2023
- Aaliyah's institutional memory (imperfect but valuable)

## What You Need to Deliver

Before the audit in 21 days, you need:

1. **Complete I-9 documentation for all 47 employees** - proper forms, supporting documents, no errors
2. **Accurate employee classification** - confirm exempt/non-exempt status for everyone
3. **Wage and hour records** - ensure hourly employees have accurate time tracking
4. **Workplace safety documentation** - required postings, safety training records
5. **Clean employee records** - one source of truth for basic info, hire dates, titles, compensation

Beyond the audit, the company needs:
- Standardized onboarding process
- Updated employee handbook (current one is from 2023 and doesn't match reality)
- Benefits administration that actually works
- A system that can scale as the company grows

## The Stakes

If Woodward Ventures fails this audit:
- Fines ranging from $252 to $2,507 per I-9 violation
- Potential penalties for misclassification (back pay, taxes, benefits)
- Board and investor scrutiny
- Personal liability concerns for executives
- Reputation damage in the tight-knit Detroit tech community

If you can't get things under control:
- The company may need to hire expensive employment lawyers
- You might be blamed for problems that predate you
- The chaos will only get worse as the company grows

No pressure for your first day.

## Hidden Complications (You'll Discover These)

As you dig through the files, you'll find:
- Employee records that don't match across systems
- Missing I-9 forms for employees hired in the "early chaos" period
- At least one employee who might be misclassified (salaried but doing non-exempt work)
- Benefits enrollment forms that were never processed
- An employee handbook that promises things the company doesn't actually offer
- Signs that Kelly was overwhelmed and cutting corners
- Incomplete background checks
- Expired policies that were never updated
- Remote employees in states where Woodward Ventures might not be properly registered

Your job is to find the truth, fix what you can, and honestly assess the risk. The company has been lucky so far. That luck is about to be tested.

## Best For

This scenario is ideal for:
- HR professionals at any level
- People Ops specialists
- Office managers taking on HR responsibilities
- Startup operators wearing multiple hats
- Anyone preparing for compliance audits
- Business owners managing their own HR

Good luck. The audit clock is ticking.
