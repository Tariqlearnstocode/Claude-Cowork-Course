## KELLY'S NOTES

**STATUS: This agreement exists but many employees haven't signed it.**

### Who Has Signed
I started asking new hires to sign this in April 2024. Employees before that date mostly never signed anything.

**Employees with signed NDAs on file:**
- E025 (David Kowalski) - Yes, signed at hire
- E026-E047 (hires after April 2024) - Most yes, some missing
- E001-E024 (hires before April 2024) - Mostly NO

### Problems

1. **No legal review.** Marcus pulled this template from the internet. A lawyer has never reviewed it. There could be unenforceable provisions.

2. **Michigan law considerations.** Michigan has specific rules about non-competes and non-solicitation. Not sure this complies.

3. **Missing signatures.** We never went back to get existing employees to sign. Marcus said "they already agreed to keep things confidential when they joined." That's not how contracts work.

4. **No tracking.** I don't have a definitive list of who signed and who didn't. Some are in TriNet, some in Google Drive, some in the filing cabinet.

5. **IP assignment scope.** The IP assignment language is very broad. Could be challenged depending on circumstances.

6. **Non-compete clause?** This doesn't have a non-compete but should we have one? Or would it not be enforceable anyway? I don't know Michigan law well enough.

### What Needs to Happen

1. Get legal review of this document
2. Determine if it's enforceable as-is
3. Decide whether to get existing employees to sign
4. Create tracking system for who has/hasn't signed
5. Add to onboarding checklist with verification

### Risk Assessment

**If an employee leaves and takes Confidential Information:**
- For employees who signed: We can pursue legal remedies
- For employees who didn't sign: We have much weaker position

**If an employee claims IP they created here:**
- For employees who signed: Company clearly owns it
- For employees who didn't sign: Potentially murky

**Specific concern:** Several engineers from early days (James Thompson, Kevin Nguyen, Tanya Robinson, etc.) were involved in building the core product and haven't signed IP assignment. If any of them ever claim ownership of their contributions, it could be a major problem for the company and for the Series A due diligence.

*This is a significant unresolved issue. A lawyer needs to look at this soon.*
