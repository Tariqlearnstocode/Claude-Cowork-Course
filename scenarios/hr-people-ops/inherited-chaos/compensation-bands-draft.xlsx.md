# Compensation Bands - DRAFT

**Created by:** Kelly Ostrowski
**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** NEVER FINALIZED - Marcus wanted this for budgeting but kept asking for changes

---

## Purpose

Marcus asked me to create "compensation bands" so he could plan for headcount growth and budgeting. I put this together based on market research and our current salaries but it was never approved.

**Sources used:**
- Levels.fyi for engineering roles
- Glassdoor for Detroit market data
- Our own internal salaries (reverse-engineered bands)
- David Kowalski's input on sales roles

## ENGINEERING

| Level | Title | Band Low | Band Mid | Band High | Current Employees |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| E1 | Junior Developer | $70,000 | $82,500 | $95,000 | Brandon Cook ($82K), Marcus Green ($85K) |
| E2 | Software Engineer | $95,000 | $110,000 | $125,000 | Multiple - see notes |
| E3 | Senior Software Engineer | $125,000 | $140,000 | $155,000 | James Thompson ($145K), Jason Clark ($140K) |
| E4 | Staff Engineer | $150,000 | $170,000 | $190,000 | None currently |
| E5 | Principal Engineer | $180,000 | $200,000 | $220,000 | None currently |

**Notes:**
- Kevin Nguyen is at $125K which is E2 high/E3 low - need to clarify his level
- DevOps engineers (David Kim, Jordan Stewart) are mapped to E2/E3 but may need separate track
- QA (Terrence Brown $95K, Mia Campbell $92K) - these feel low for senior QA. Detroit market?

### Issues I Found

1. **No clear leveling criteria.** What makes someone E2 vs E3? Priya promotes based on gut feel.
2. **Compression issues.** Some E2s make more than E3s based on when they were hired.
3. **James Thompson at $145K** is above E3 high. Either he's underpaid for E4 or overpaid for E3.

## SALES

| Level | Title | Base Low | Base Mid | Base High | OTE Low | OTE Mid | OTE High |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| S1 | SDR | $42,000 | $48,000 | $54,000 | $55,000 | $65,000 | $75,000 |
| S2 | Account Executive | $60,000 | $70,000 | $80,000 | $120,000 | $140,000 | $160,000 |
| S3 | Senior AE | $75,000 | $87,500 | $100,000 | $150,000 | $175,000 | $200,000 |
| Sales Mgmt | VP Sales | $140,000 | $165,000 | $190,000 | $220,000 | $260,000 | $300,000 |

**Notes:**
- SDRs (Stephanie Moore, Jerome Phillips) are currently hourly non-exempt at ~$22/hr (~$45K). This is right.
- All AEs are at $65K base which is band low. David says he wants to give raises but budget isn't there.
- David Kowalski at $165K base is mid-band for VP Sales.

### Issues I Found

1. **Commission structure is unclear.** I don't have visibility into how commissions are calculated.
2. **No clear promotion path** from SDR to AE. Two SDRs have asked about this.
3. **OTE never discussed in hiring.** We just say "$65K base plus commission."

## CUSTOMER SUCCESS

| Level | Title | Band Low | Band Mid | Band High | Current Employees |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| CS1 | Support Specialist | $45,000 | $52,500 | $60,000 | Cynthia Davis, Lauren Carter |
| CS2 | Customer Success Manager | $62,000 | $72,000 | $82,000 | Multiple CSMs |
| CS3 | Senior CSM | $78,000 | $88,000 | $98,000 | None currently |
| CS4 | CS Manager/Director | $95,000 | $110,000 | $125,000 | None currently |

**Notes:**
- Support specialists are hourly non-exempt at $24/hr (~$50K) which is mid-band
- CSMs are all between $68-72K which clusters around low-mid band
- No one at CS3 level - is there a career path issue?

### Issues I Found

1. **Exempt classification problem.** CSMs are all salaried exempt but their work is fairly routine. Are they actually exempt under FLSA? The "administrative exemption" requires "exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance." Do our CSMs actually have that authority?

2. **No CSM manager.** CSMs report to Marcus who has no time for them. They need a dedicated manager.

## MARKETING

| Level | Title | Band Low | Band Mid | Band High |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| M1 | Marketing Coordinator | $45,000 | $55,000 | $65,000 |
| M2 | Marketing Specialist/Manager | $65,000 | $77,500 | $90,000 |
| M3 | Senior Manager | $85,000 | $97,500 | $110,000 |
| M4 | Director | $100,000 | $120,000 | $140,000 |

**Notes:**
- Brianna Jackson (Marketing Manager) at $85K is band high for M2 or band low for M3
- Keisha Lewis (Content) at $75K is mid M2
- Vanessa Nelson (Demand Gen) at $72K is low-mid M2
- Aaliyah Reed (Marketing Ops) at $68K is low M2

### Issues I Found

1. **Brianna's title vs responsibility.** She's "Marketing Manager" but she manages the whole department. Should be Director?
2. **Market data is noisy** for marketing in Detroit. Hard to benchmark.

## OPERATIONS & ADMIN

| Level | Title | Band Low | Band Mid | Band High |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| O1 | Admin/Coordinator | $40,000 | $48,000 | $56,000 |
| O2 | Office Manager/Specialist | $52,000 | $62,000 | $72,000 |
| O3 | HR Manager/Sr. Specialist | $70,000 | $82,500 | $95,000 |

**Notes:**
- Aaliyah Washington (Office Manager) at $59K ($28.50/hr) is low-mid O2
- Tiffany Morgan (AP/AR Clerk, PT) at $21/hr (~$27K pro-rated) is O1 level

### Issues I Found

1. **Aaliyah is underpaid.** She's been here since the beginning and runs operations. $59K for Detroit Office Manager with her experience is low.

## FINANCE

| Level | Title | Band Low | Band Mid | Band High |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| F1 | Bookkeeper/Clerk | $40,000 | $48,000 | $56,000 |
| F2 | Staff Accountant | $60,000 | $72,500 | $85,000 |
| F3 | Senior Accountant/Controller | $85,000 | $100,000 | $115,000 |
| CFO | CFO (fractional rate) | varies | varies | varies |

**Notes:**
- Natasha Collins (Staff Accountant) at $75K is mid F2
- CFO is fractional, paid hourly

---

## EXECUTIVE

Not banded. Founders set their own comp. Board approves.

Current:
- Marcus Chen (CEO): $185K
- Priya Patel (CTO): $175K
- David Kowalski (VP Sales): $165K base + commission (OTE ~$260K)

---

## PROBLEMS WITH THIS WHOLE EXERCISE

1. **Bands created after-the-fact.** I built bands around existing salaries rather than market data. This locks in existing inequities.

2. **No leveling criteria.** We have titles but no clear definition of what E2 vs E3 means. Promotions are arbitrary.

3. **Compression everywhere.** People hired recently in a tight market got higher offers than tenured employees at the same level.

4. **Geographic pay?** We have remote employees in different markets. Should they be paid differently? We haven't decided.

5. **Equity compensation not included.** Early employees have stock options but recent hires don't. Total comp varies wildly.

6. **Marcus never approved this.** He kept asking for changes and I couldn't get him to make a decision.

---

## ACTION NEEDED

1. Decide: Are these bands official or not?
2. Review existing salaries against bands - identify outliers
3. Create clear leveling criteria for each track
4. Decide on geographic pay policy
5. Plan for equity refresh for employees without options
6. Address CSM classification issue (seriously, this could be a legal problem)
