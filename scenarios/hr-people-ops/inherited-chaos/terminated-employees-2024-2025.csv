NOTES:
- I-9 forms for terminated employees need to be retained for 3 years from hire OR 1 year from termination whichever is LATER
- I have not been tracking this properly - need to audit
- COBRA notice is required within 44 days of qualifying event - not sure all were sent properly
- We have never done exit interviews despite handbook saying we do
- Equipment return has been inconsistent - Aaliyah usually handles
- No severance agreements - we don't have a policy
- Derek Washington termination - should have documented more. No PIP paperwork on file. Could be problematic if he ever claims wrongful termination.
- Amy Chen COBRA - I THINK I sent it but can't find confirmation. This is a problem if she didn't receive it.
