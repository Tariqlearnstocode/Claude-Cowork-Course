## KELLY'S NOTES

**Problems with this template:**

1. **Legal review needed** - This was drafted by Marcus and me. No lawyer has ever looked at it. There could be issues.

2. **At-will language** - I think this is fine but should be reviewed. Some states have exceptions to at-will employment that we should address.

3. **Benefits section is wrong** - Says 30/60 days as placeholder but we changed to 30 days. Also percentages are wrong (says 75%/80% when it's actually 75%/50%).

4. **401(k) description** - Says "3%/matching" as placeholder. Actual is 3% match. We should be clearer about how the match works.

5. **PTO** - Has placeholder for 10/15/20 days but we don't have a real policy. Most people are told 15 days verbally but handbook says 10.

6. **Non-compete?** - Some companies include non-compete language. We don't have any. Should we? Probably needs legal input.

7. **Arbitration clause?** - Many tech companies include mandatory arbitration. We don't have one. Should we add it? DEFINITELY needs legal.

8. **Confidentiality agreement** - The letter references it but I'm not sure we actually have employees sign one consistently.

9. **Salary negotiation records** - We don't document what was negotiated. David Kowalski has 20 days PTO because he asked for it, but it's not in his offer letter. This could cause problems.

10. **Remote work terms** - No specific language about remote work expectations, equipment, or reimbursement.

**High risk issues:**

- If benefits in offer letter don't match reality, employees could have claims
- At-will language may not be enforceable in all situations
- Missing arbitration could mean we're exposed to class action lawsuits
- No NDA/IP assignment language in the letter itself

**What needs to happen:**

1. GET A LAWYER TO REVIEW THIS
2. Update benefits to match actual offerings
3. Create separate benefits summary document that offer letter can reference
4. Consider whether to add non-compete, arbitration, or other provisions
5. Standardize what gets negotiated and how it's documented

*I've been using this template for 2 years. I hope it doesn't come back to bite us.*
