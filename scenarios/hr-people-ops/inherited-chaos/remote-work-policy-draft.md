## Tax and Legal Considerations

### Multi-State Employment
Employees who work remotely from a state other than Michigan must be approved in advance.

Considerations include:
- State employer registration requirements
- State income tax withholding
- Unemployment insurance
- Workers' compensation coverage
- State-specific employment laws

*[Note: WE ARE NOT DOING THIS PROPERLY. See state compliance doc.]*

### Temporary Remote Work
Employees may request to work remotely from a different location temporarily (e.g., visiting family). If exceeding 2 weeks, must be approved by HR.

---

## Application Process

To request remote or hybrid work:
1. Discuss with manager
2. Submit request to HR with:
   - Desired arrangement
   - Proposed schedule
   - Justification
3. HR and manager review
4. Decision communicated within 2 weeks

---

## COVID and Health Considerations

Remote work may be required or encouraged during:
- Public health emergencies
- Building closures
- Employee illness (to prevent spread)

---

## Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as needed.

---

## WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS (Kelly's notes)

The above is what I drafted. Here's reality:

**How remote work decisions are actually made:**
1. Employee asks their manager
2. Manager says yes or no based on vibes
3. Maybe they tell HR, maybe they don't
4. Employee starts working remotely
5. HR finds out eventually when something breaks (wrong tax withholding, etc.)

**Why this policy was never approved:**

**Marcus's position:**
- Wants flexibility to attract talent
- Comfortable with remote for proven performers
- Concerned about culture/collaboration
- "Use judgment on a case-by-case basis"

**Priya's position:**
- Strongly prefers remote-friendly
- Doesn't see why anyone needs to be in office
- Thinks requiring office time is "old school"
- "Engineers work best with minimal interruption"

**David's position:**
- Wants sales team in office for "energy"
- Concerned about managing remote SDRs
- "Ramping reps need to be around the team"

**My position:**
- We need a written policy for consistency and compliance
- The multi-state issues are real and not being addressed
- Case-by-case decisions without criteria lead to perceived unfairness
- Nobody listened to me

**The meeting to finalize this policy:**
- Scheduled for September 2025
- Marcus rescheduled twice
- Finally met, debated for an hour, no agreement
- "Let's table this and revisit next quarter"
- Never revisited

---

## Current State (Informal)

**Engineering:** Basically do whatever they want. Priya approves everything.

**Sales:** David prefers in-office. Most are hybrid. New SDRs expected to be in-office.

**CS:** Mix. Marcus approves case-by-case. No consistency.

**Marketing:** Mostly hybrid. Brianna manages this for her team.

**Ops/Finance:** Mostly in-office by default.

**Remote employees in other states:**
- Miguel Garcia (OH) - approved by Priya before anyone thought about compliance
- Jasmine King (OH) - approved by Priya
- Nicole Harris (IL) - approved by Marcus
- Alexis Turner (TX) - approved by Marcus
- Jason Clark possibly moving to TX? - unresolved when I left

**Equipment:**
- Laptops for everyone
- Monitors given to some remote people, not others (depends on who asked)
- No formal process

**Reimbursement:**
- None. Employees pay their own internet.
- Some people have asked. Marcus said we'd "look into it."

*We really need a real policy. This is a mess.*
