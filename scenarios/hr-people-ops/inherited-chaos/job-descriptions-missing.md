## Overview

Job descriptions are critical for:
- Setting clear expectations

**Our status:** We're missing job descriptions for most roles.

## CSM Job Description - Classification Concern

**Current JD for Customer Success Manager:**

*Title: Customer Success Manager*
*Reports to: CEO*
*FLSA Status: Exempt*

*Summary:*
The Customer Success Manager is responsible for ensuring customers achieve maximum value from the BuildFlow platform. This includes onboarding new customers, providing ongoing support, identifying upsell opportunities, and serving as the voice of the customer within the organization.

*Responsibilities:*
- Onboard new customers and conduct training sessions
- Monitor customer health and proactively address issues
- Respond to customer inquiries and resolve problems
- Conduct quarterly business reviews with assigned accounts
- Identify opportunities for expansion and upsell
- Collaborate with Product team on customer feedback
- Maintain accurate records in CRM
- Achieve retention and expansion targets

*Qualifications:*
- 2+ years experience in customer success or account management
- Experience with SaaS products
- Strong communication skills
- Detail-oriented and organized
- Bachelor's degree preferred

**The Problem:**

For administrative exemption, the employee must:
1. Be paid on a salary basis at least $684/week ($35,568/year) - CHECK
2. Primary duty is office work related to management or business operations - MAYBE
3. Exercise discretion and independent judgment on matters of significance - QUESTIONABLE

**Looking at what CSMs actually do:**
- Follow scripts for onboarding
- Respond to tickets using templates
- Escalate complex issues to managers
- Schedule calls that were requested
- Enter data into CRM
- Participate in meetings run by others

**They do NOT typically:**
- Set policies
- Negotiate contracts or pricing
- Make decisions that affect the business significantly
- Supervise others
- Have authority to deviate from standard processes

**Comparison to Support Specialists (non-exempt):**
CSMs do basically the same thing as Support Specialists but with assigned accounts instead of ticket queue. The work is very similar. Why are CSMs exempt and Support Specialists non-exempt?

**Jessica Martinez raised this issue.** She's right to be concerned.

If we reclassify CSMs as non-exempt:
- 7 employees affected (including 2 in other states)
- Potential back overtime for 2+ years
- Significant cost

If we don't reclassify and get audited:
- Department of Labor could force reclassification
- Pay back wages
- Pay penalties
- Very bad look

**We need legal advice on this.** I raised it multiple times. Never got direction.

## JDs We Have (File Locations)

The job descriptions we do have are in: HR Shared > Job Descriptions

Files:
- Software Engineer - Generic.docx (covers all engineering titles)
- Customer Success Manager.docx (problematic, see above)
- Account Executive.docx (outdated)
- Marketing Manager.docx (from Brianna's hiring)
- HR Manager.docx (from my hiring, outdated)

---

## What Needs to Happen

### Immediate (for audit)
1. Review CSM classification with employment lawyer
2. Have JDs available to support FLSA classifications auditors might question

### Short-term
1. Write JDs for all roles that don't have them
2. Update outdated JDs
3. Get manager sign-off on JDs
4. Share with employees (so they know expectations)

### Ongoing
1. Update JDs when roles change
2. Use JDs in performance conversations
3. Use JDs in recruiting

I started creating a JD template but never finished. It's in HR Shared > Templates > job-description-template-draft.docx

It includes:
- Job title
- Department
- Reports to
- FLSA status
- Summary
- Essential functions
- Qualifications
- Physical requirements (for ADA)

*This is one of those things that seems like paperwork but actually matters for compliance and management. We've been winging it.*
