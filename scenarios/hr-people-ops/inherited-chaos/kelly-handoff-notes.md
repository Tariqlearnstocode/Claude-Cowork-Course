## Quick handoff for whoever takes this over

I'm sorry I'm leaving so suddenly. I know this isn't ideal. Here's what you need to know:

### Immediate Priorities

1. **THE AUDIT** - Michigan LEO scheduled a compliance audit. It's in about 3-4 weeks (check email for exact date). They want I-9s, wage/hour records, and safety stuff. We're NOT READY. More below.

2. **Payroll** - Runs every other Friday through Gusto. Aaliyah knows the basics. The login is in my password doc (ask IT - I think Marcus has access to my 1Password).

3. **Benefits** - Open enrollment is coming up in February. We use BCBS for health. Aaliyah has the broker contact (Tom at Michigan Benefits Advisors).

### Where Things Are

- Employee files: Mix of Google Drive, Gusto, and that TriNet system we never finished setting up
- I-9 forms: Some in the filing cabinet by my desk (yes, paper), some in the "HR - I9 Forms" folder in Drive
- Handbook: "Employee Handbook v2.3" in the HR Shared folder. It's from 2023 and needs updating
- Org chart: There's a Lucidchart somewhere but it's probably outdated

### Known Problems

**I-9s:**
- We have I-9s for everyone hired in 2025
- For 2024 and earlier... it's spotty. A bunch of people were hired before I started (I joined March 2024) and the "system" was basically Marcus's personal folder
- I know we're missing some. I kept meaning to do an audit and run out of time
- Section 2 might not be complete on some - I was still learning the rules when I started

**Exempt/Non-Exempt:**
- Most of the engineers are exempt (salaried, threshold is fine)
- Sales team is exempt (outside sales exemption)
- Customer Success - this is where it gets dicey. They're all salaried but some of them are doing pretty routine work. Jessica Martinez specifically brought this up to me once. I meant to research it but... didn't
- Support specialists are hourly, that's correct

**Time Tracking:**
- Hourly employees use Gusto time tracking
- SOME exempt employees also track time for project billing purposes (engineering on client work)
- It's a mess. I don't think we're fully compliant on break documentation for hourly folks

**Remote Employees:**
- We have people in Ohio, Illinois, and Texas
- I honestly don't know if we're properly registered in those states
- I set up withholding in Gusto but that might not be enough?
- This could be a big problem. Marcus said to "look into it" but never followed up

### Things I Never Got To

- [ ] Finish setting up TriNet (we're paying for it and barely using it)
- [ ] Proper onboarding documentation (everyone gets a different experience)
- [ ] Update the handbook (so many things are wrong or outdated)
- [ ] Performance review process (we do them but there's no system)
- [ ] Manager training (they're all winging it)
- [ ] Fix the PTO tracking (some in Gusto, some on spreadsheets, some nowhere)
- [ ] Proper job descriptions for half the roles
- [ ] Background check follow-ups (some came back with questions, never resolved)

### Important Contacts

- Tom Brennan, Michigan Benefits Advisors: (313) 555-0234 - health insurance broker
- Linda at Gusto support: She knows our account, very helpful
- TriNet implementation person: Gave up on us honestly, don't know current contact
- Employment lawyer: We don't have one retained. Marcus said "we'll get one when we need one"

### Files to Find

- "master employee list.xlsx" - my attempt at a single source of truth. It's in HR Shared but I know it's not 100% accurate
- "compensation bands draft" - never finished, Marcus wanted this for budgeting
- "interview questions bank" - template I was building
- "offer letter template v3" - the current one, but legal never reviewed it

### Personal Notes

Look, I'm going to be honest. This job broke me a little. When I joined, there were 28 employees. Now there's 47. I went from "HR generalist supporting a small team" to "building HR from scratch at a rapidly scaling startup" and I wasn't ready for it.

Marcus is a good guy but he doesn't understand HR. He thinks it should just "work." Priya actively resists any process that slows down engineering. I was always fighting upstream.

The company has a lot of potential. The product is good. The people are mostly great. But the HR infrastructure is held together with duct tape and good intentions.

Whoever takes this over - set boundaries early. Document everything. And get an employment lawyer BEFORE you need one.

Good luck.

## Random notes from my notebook

*Transcribed from the spiral notebook on my desk*

**Nov 12** - Marcus mentioned Series A timeline. "Need to clean up HR before due diligence." Yeah, no kidding.

**Nov 15** - Priya complained again that engineers have to do compliance training. She doesn't understand that's non-negotiable. We literally have a safety product - we need to practice what we sell.

**Nov 18** - Got the letter from Michigan LEO. Audit scheduled. Showed Marcus. His face went white. "Can we push it?" No, Marcus. That's not how audits work.

**Nov 20** - Started the I-9 audit. Stopped after finding 6 problems in the first 10 files. This is going to take forever.

**Nov 22** - Tom Brennan called about open enrollment. I didn't return the call. I can't deal with one more thing.

**Nov 25** - Offer from GreenPath came through. Better title, better pay, actual HR team to work with. I think I'm going to take it.

**Nov 28** - Gave notice. Marcus seemed shocked. "I thought things were going well?" No, Marcus. I've been drowning and waving and you thought I was waving back.

**Dec 1** - Last day. I should feel bad about leaving like this but I just feel relief.

*I really am sorry. I hope you can sort this out.*
