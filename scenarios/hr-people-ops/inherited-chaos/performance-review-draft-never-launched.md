# Performance Review Process - DRAFT

**Created by:** Kelly Ostrowski
**Date:** July 2025
**Status:** NEVER LAUNCHED - Marcus kept asking for changes

---

## Overview

This document outlines a proposed performance review process for Woodward Ventures. The goal is to create a consistent, fair system for evaluating employee performance and having development conversations.

---

## Proposed Cycle

### Annual Reviews
- **Timing:** January (aligned with fiscal year)
- **Covers:** Previous calendar year performance
- **Linked to:** Annual salary review consideration (not guaranteed)

### Mid-Year Check-ins
- **Timing:** July
- **Purpose:** Progress update, course correction, informal feedback
- **Not linked to:** Compensation changes

---

## Proposed Process

### Step 1: Self-Assessment (Employee)
Employee completes self-assessment covering:
- Key accomplishments in review period
- Areas where they fell short of goals
- Skills/knowledge developed
- Goals for next period
- Career development interests
- Feedback on role/team/company

### Step 2: Manager Assessment (Manager)
Manager completes assessment covering:
- Rating on core competencies (see below)
- Rating on role-specific responsibilities
- Strengths observed
- Areas for development
- Recommendations for next review period

### Step 3: Calibration (Leadership)
Department heads meet to:
- Review ratings across teams
- Ensure consistency in application of ratings
- Discuss high performers and struggling employees
- Align on compensation recommendations (if applicable)

### Step 4: Review Meeting (Manager + Employee)
Manager and employee meet to:
- Discuss assessments
- Align on final ratings
- Set goals for next period
- Discuss development plan
- Address any concerns

### Step 5: Documentation (HR)
HR:
- Files completed reviews
- Tracks completion rates
- Compiles feedback themes
- Supports compensation planning

## Proposed Rating Scale

**5 - Exceptional:** Consistently exceeds expectations. Role model for others. Delivers outstanding results.

**4 - Exceeds Expectations:** Regularly exceeds expectations. Strong performer who often goes above and beyond.

**3 - Meets Expectations:** Consistently meets expectations. Solid, reliable performance. This is the expected rating for most employees.

**2 - Below Expectations:** Sometimes meets expectations but inconsistent. Needs improvement in key areas.

**1 - Does Not Meet Expectations:** Rarely meets expectations. Serious performance concerns. May be on or headed toward PIP.

## What Happened to This Project

### July 2025
Created initial draft. Shared with Marcus for review.

### August 2025
Marcus said he liked it but wanted to add OKRs. Asked me to research OKR integration.

### September 2025
I added an OKR component. Marcus said it was "too complicated" now. Asked me to simplify.

### October 2025
Simplified version shared. Marcus said we should wait until after Q4 to launch because "people are busy with year-end."

### November 2025
I suggested launching in January for the Q4 review period. Marcus said "let's revisit in the new year."

Then I left.

## Current State of Performance Management

**What we do now:**
- Informal feedback (inconsistent)
- Ad-hoc salary increases (when someone complains or threatens to leave)
- No documented goals
- No development conversations
- No calibration

**Problems this causes:**
- Managers don't know how to give feedback
- Employees don't know where they stand
- Raises feel arbitrary (because they are)
- No paper trail for performance issues
- Can't defend termination decisions if challenged
- No career paths or development support

---

## My Recommendation

This process isn't perfect but it's better than nothing. I'd suggest:

1. **Start simple:** Just do the annual review piece first. Add mid-year check-ins later.

2. **Get manager buy-in:** Train managers on how to have review conversations. They've never done this formally.

3. **Don't tie first cycle to compensation:** First time through, just gather data. People will be more honest if there's no money attached.

4. **Use a tool:** Doing this on paper/email is painful. TriNet has performance management but we never set it up. Or use Lattice, 15Five, Culture Amp, etc.

5. **Be realistic about timing:** If you launch in January, managers need training in December. That's right now. Probably too late for this year.

*This was one of my bigger disappointments. We really need a performance management process but I could never get leadership to prioritize it.*
