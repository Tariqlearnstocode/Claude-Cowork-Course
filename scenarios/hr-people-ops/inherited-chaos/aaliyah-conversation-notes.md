## What Aaliyah Told You

*These are your notes from the conversation, written immediately after*

---

### On Kelly's Departure

"Kelly was a good person but she was drowning. When she started, we had like 28 people. By the time she left, we had 47. Marcus kept hiring but never gave Kelly help. She was doing payroll, benefits, onboarding, compliance, employee relations, office admin - everything. I tried to help where I could but I have my own stuff."

"She stopped being able to keep up about six months ago. Things started falling through cracks. I'd hear people complain that their PTO wasn't right, or they never got an answer about their benefits question. Kelly would apologize but nothing changed because there wasn't time."

"The audit notice was the last straw. When she showed Marcus the letter, he acted surprised. But like... we'd been telling him we had compliance problems. He just didn't want to hear it."

---

### On the I-9 Situation

"The early days were chaos. Marcus and Priya were coding and selling. HR was whatever they could Google. I helped with some of it but I didn't know what I was doing either."

"I remember when James Thompson started - our first real hire. I don't think anyone did an I-9. We were so excited to have help, we just put him to work. It wasn't until Kelly came that we started doing proper paperwork."

"The founders definitely don't have I-9s. Marcus will probably say something like 'I own the company, I don't need to prove I can work here.' But that's not how it works, right?"

"For the remote employees - Miguel in Ohio was hired before Kelly too. I honestly have no idea if his paperwork was done right. Kelly tried to audit everything when she started but she inherited such a mess."

---

### On the State Compliance Issues

"The out-of-state thing has been a concern for a while. When we hired Nicole in Chicago, Kelly brought it up in a leadership meeting. Marcus said we'd 'figure it out' but then never followed up."

"Same with Texas when Alexis started. Kelly was really worried about it. She asked Marcus to hire a consultant or lawyer to sort it out. He said the budget was tight."

"I think he's hoping if we just don't look too hard, there won't be a problem. But now there's an audit, so..."

---

### On Benefits and PTO

"Benefits are a mess. Every time someone asks me a question I have to guess or go dig through five different places. Is it in Gusto? TriNet? That spreadsheet Kelly kept? The handbook? They all say different things."

"The PTO situation is funny - or it would be if it wasn't our job to fix it. Old employees like me are supposed to have 10 days. New employees get told 15 days. David negotiated 20. Nobody actually tracks it the same way."

"My PTO balance is definitely wrong somewhere. I've been here four years and I've never taken a real vacation. Between you and me, Marcus said early on that we couldn't afford for me to take time off. So I just... haven't. The hours show 40 but honey, I'm here before 8 and after 6 most days."

*[Note to self: Aaliyah just told me she's been working unpaid overtime for 4 years. This is a serious problem.]*

---

### On the Handbook

"That handbook is a joke. It says 10 days PTO, wrong benefits info, wrong everything. New hires read it and then come ask me 'but someone told me it was 15 days?' and I have to explain we just never updated it."

"Kelly tried to update it but Marcus kept asking for changes and then never approving the final version. It's been 'in progress' for a year."

---

### On Priya

"Priya is brilliant but she doesn't understand why HR matters. To her, anything that isn't shipping code is waste. She pushed back on Kelly constantly - compliance training, onboarding time, even just asking engineers to fill out forms."

"You'll have to find a way to work with her. She's not mean, she just... her priority is the product. Everything else is a distraction."

"If you need to do something that affects engineering, go through Marcus first. Get his buy-in before approaching Priya."

---

### On Marcus

"Marcus is a good guy. He started this company because he genuinely wanted to solve a problem for construction companies. He's not trying to cut corners maliciously - he just doesn't know what he doesn't know about HR."

"He'll say yes to things and then forget. If you need something from him, get it in writing. Follow up. Be persistent but not annoying."

"The Series A fundraise is on his mind constantly. He wants the company to look good for investors. That could work in your favor if you frame HR fixes as 'getting the company ready for due diligence.'"

---

### On What Needs to Happen

"Honestly? This place needs more than just an HR Manager. We need an actual HR function. Policies that are written down and followed. Systems that work. Someone who has time to actually do the job."

"But right now, you just need to survive the audit. Twenty-one days, right? Focus on that first."

---

### On How She Can Help

"I know where everything is - or at least where it probably is. If you can't find a file, ask me. I've been the institutional memory around here for four years."

"I can help with onboarding logistics, office stuff, coordinating meetings. What I can't do is your actual HR work - I don't have the expertise and frankly I don't want that responsibility."

"I'll be honest with you about things, even when it's uncomfortable. Kelly appreciated that. I hope you do too."

## Your Observations

*Additional notes you made after the conversation*

- Aaliyah seems genuinely invested in the company succeeding
- She's clearly overworked and underpaid (see: overtime issue)
- She has valuable institutional knowledge
- She's diplomatic but honest about problems
- She's potentially a good ally as I figure things out
- I need to address the overtime issue but carefully - she could file a wage claim

## Questions to Follow Up On

1. Who did HR before Kelly? Just Marcus?
2. Where are the original employee files from 2022?
3. What exactly is Aaliyah's job description vs. what she actually does?
4. Is there anyone else who might have historical context?
5. When is the lease up on the office? (she mentioned facilities - might be relevant)
6. What's the real deal with the Series A timeline?
