## Other State Postings (Remote Employees)

**Problem:** Do we need to provide state-specific postings to remote employees in Ohio, Illinois, and Texas?

**Answer:** Probably yes, in electronic form.

**Have we done this?** No.

**What's needed:**
- Ohio: 6+ required postings
- Illinois: 8+ required postings
- Texas: 5+ required postings

**Action needed:** Get electronic copies of all required postings for each state and distribute to remote employees.

---

## OSHA Recordkeeping

### OSHA Form 300 (Log of Work-Related Injuries/Illnesses)

**Required?** Depends on company size and industry.
- Companies with 10 or fewer employees are exempt
- We have 47 employees, so we're NOT exempt
- Software companies are typically exempt from routine recordkeeping but NOT from reporting serious injuries

**Do we have one?** No.

**Have we had any work-related injuries?** I don't think so? No one has ever reported one to me.

### OSHA Form 300A (Summary)

**Required?** If we need Form 300, we need to post the 300A summary from February 1 - April 30 each year.

**Have we done this?** No. I didn't even know this was required until I started researching for the audit.

### OSHA Form 301 (Incident Reports)

**Required?** Must be completed within 7 days of any recordable injury.

**Do we have any?** N/A since we haven't had any reported injuries.

---

## Workers' Compensation

**Do we have coverage?** Yes, through Employers Insurance Company of Wausau

**Policy number:** WC-4821-7756-2025

**Coverage:** Michigan only - THIS IS A PROBLEM for out-of-state employees

**Premium:** ~$8,200/year

**Certificate location:** Should be in HR files, I think Aaliyah has a copy

**Posting:** We're supposed to post information about workers' comp but I don't think we do

## Safety Training

### What's Required

For a typical office/software company:
- Emergency action plan (fire, evacuation)
- First aid/CPR (recommended, not always required)
- Ergonomics (recommended)
- Workplace violence prevention (recommended)
- Sexual harassment prevention (required in some states, recommended everywhere)

### What We've Done

| Training | Completed? | When | Who Attended | Documentation |
|----------|------------|------|--------------|---------------|
| Fire/Evacuation | Informal | 2024 sometime | Whoever was there that day | None |
| First Aid | No | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Ergonomics | No | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Harassment Prevention | Partial | July 2024 | New hires only | Some Gusto completion records |
| Workplace Violence | No | N/A | N/A | N/A |

### Michigan-Specific Requirements

**Sexual Harassment Training:** While not technically required by Michigan law for private employers, it's strongly recommended and may affect our liability in harassment claims.

**What we did:** We set up a harassment prevention module in Gusto for new hires. Maybe 60% of employees have completed it. Existing employees when it was launched were supposed to complete it but many didn't and I stopped following up.

## Emergency Preparedness

### Fire Safety

**Fire extinguishers:** Building provides, I assume they're maintained?

**Evacuation routes:** Posted by building, not our responsibility

**Assembly point:** I told people it's the corner of Woodward and Congress. Not documented.

**Fire drills:** The building does them occasionally. We participate.

### Emergency Contacts

**Building security:** (313) 555-9000

**Building management:** (313) 555-9001

**Fire/Police/EMS:** 911

**Corporate emergency contact:** Marcus Chen (313) 555-0101

### First Aid

**First aid kit location:** Kitchen cabinet, bottom shelf

**Contents:** I stocked it once when we moved in. Haven't checked since.

**AED:** Building has one in the lobby. Our floor doesn't have one.

---

## Ergonomics

**Workstation assessments:** Never done

**Equipment provided:** Standard desks and chairs. Employees can request standing desks or other equipment and it's usually approved.

**Remote employee equipment:** We give them a laptop. Some have requested monitors, chairs, etc. No formal policy.

**Known issues:**
- James Thompson complained about back pain, bought his own chair
- Brianna Jackson requested standing desk, approved and purchased
- No systematic approach

## Issues to Address for Audit

### Critical (Must Fix Before Audit)

1. [ ] **Federal postings** - Get all required federal posters and display them
2. [ ] **Michigan postings** - Get all required state posters and display them
3. [ ] **Workers' comp certificate** - Have available for auditor
4. [ ] **OSHA 300 log** - Create one (can be blank if no injuries)
5. [ ] **Emergency action plan** - Document in writing

### High Priority (Should Fix)

1. [ ] **Out-of-state postings** - Electronic distribution to remote employees
2. [ ] **Harassment training** - Complete for all employees
3. [ ] **Workers' comp coverage** - Extend to other states where we have employees
4. [ ] **First aid kit** - Restock and document

### Medium Priority (Address Soon)

1. [ ] **Ergonomic assessments** - At least for employees who request
2. [ ] **Additional safety training** - First aid, ergonomics
3. [ ] **Remote work safety** - Policy and acknowledgment

## Where to Get Postings

**Federal:** DOL has a poster advisor tool: https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/posters.htm

**Michigan:** LARA website or order from state

**Combo posters:** Companies like ComplyRight or Poster Guard sell all-in-one posters ($30-50)

I was going to order the combo poster but then I left. Someone should do this ASAP.
