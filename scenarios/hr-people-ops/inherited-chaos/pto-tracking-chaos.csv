SUMMARY NOTES:
- PTO policy changed informally from 10 days to 15 days around March 2023 when David Kim was hired
- Original employees (pre-March 2023) were never officially moved to 15 days but some were told informally
- Employee handbook still says 10 days
- David Kowalski negotiated 20 days as part of his offer (not documented anywhere official)
- At least 8 employees have discrepancies between my count and Gusto
- At least 5 employees think they have more PTO than either system shows
- Carryover policy is unclear - handbook says use it or lose it but we've never enforced
- No one has ever been denied PTO request - we approve everything and figure it out later
- Michigan ESTA (Earned Sick Time Act) requirements not clearly integrated into PTO

PROBLEMS TO FIX:
1. Reconcile all three data sources (my spreadsheet Gusto and employee expectations)
2. Decide: Are early employees on 10 days or 15 days?
3. Document David's 20-day agreement somewhere official
4. Update handbook to reflect actual policy
5. Clarify carryover policy
6. Figure out ESTA compliance
