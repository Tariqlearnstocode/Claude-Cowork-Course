## Top 5 Things That Will Kill You in the Audit

### 1. I-9 Problems
- Founders (Marcus, Priya) have NO I-9 forms
- Several early employees have incomplete I-9s
- Remote employees may not have proper I-9 verification
- I started an audit and found ~47% error rate in my sample
- **See:** `i9-audit-partial.md`

### 2. Employee Classification
- CSMs are classified as exempt but may not meet duties test
- Jessica Martinez specifically asked about this
- If they're misclassified, we owe overtime going back years
- **See:** `jessica-martinez-classification-concern.md`, `job-descriptions-missing.md`

### 3. Time Tracking / Off-the-Clock Work
- Aaliyah (Office Manager) works 50+ hours but records 40
- Support staff may be working off the clock
- This is wage theft - even if employees are willing
- **See:** `time-tracking-issues.md`

### 4. Workplace Postings
- We're probably missing several required posters
- I started a checklist but didn't finish
- **See:** `workplace-safety-checklist.md`

### 5. Employee Records
- Data is scattered across Gusto, TriNet, Google Drive, and paper files
- No single source of truth
- Many records have inconsistencies
- **See:** `employee-master-list.csv`

My logins need to be transferred to you. Ask Aaliyah to contact IT (which is also Aaliyah for the most part, or Marcus's nephew who helps sometimes).

- **Gusto:** My email, password in 1Password
- **TriNet:** My email, password in 1Password
- **Google Drive:** HR Shared folder has most things
- **1Password:** Ask Marcus for access to transfer vault

## Immediate Action Items (First Week)

- [ ] Get all system access transferred
- [ ] Find the audit notification letter (I left a copy on my desk)
- [ ] Start I-9 audit from where I left off
- [ ] Order required workplace posters (takes a few days to ship)
- [ ] Call Tom Brennan about benefits
- [ ] Identify which employees are in which states
- [ ] Find workers' comp certificate

## If You Only Do One Thing

**Get the I-9s fixed.** That's what they're going to look at most closely.

Missing I-9 = violation = fine
Incomplete I-9 = violation = fine
Late I-9 = violation = fine

At $252-$2,507 per violation, this is where the money is. Fix the I-9s.

## I'm Sorry

I know I'm leaving you a mess. I tried my best but there was too much work for one person, not enough support, and by the end I was just burned out.

The company has potential. The people are mostly good. The HR infrastructure is a disaster. But you can fix it - just don't try to do it alone.

Push for resources. Push for a lawyer. Push for a real budget. And if they won't give you what you need, don't make my mistake - don't stay too long trying to make it work with nothing.

Good luck. You've got this.

- Kelly

P.S. The good coffee is in the cabinet above the sink. The k-cups in the basket are terrible.
