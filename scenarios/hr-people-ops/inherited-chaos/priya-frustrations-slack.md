## October 2025

**Priya Patel** 10/3/25 9:15 AM
@kelly.o why did my team have to stop what they're doing for "harassment training"? We're 3 weeks from a major release.

**Kelly Ostrowski** 10/3/25 9:22 AM
Hi Priya - it's required training that should have been completed months ago. The module is only 45 minutes and can be done at any time this week. Happy to discuss alternatives to the timing.

**Priya Patel** 10/3/25 9:24 AM
45 minutes x 18 engineers = 13.5 hours of lost productivity. That's almost 2 engineering days. Do you know what we could ship in 2 days?

**Kelly Ostrowski** 10/3/25 9:28 AM
I understand the timing is difficult. Unfortunately, this training protects the company from liability and is industry standard. Most companies require it annually. We can discuss doing it after your release if that helps, but it does need to happen.

**Priya Patel** 10/3/25 9:31 AM
"Protects the company from liability" - we're a small startup. We don't need the bureaucracy of a big company. Everyone on my team is professional. This feels like checkbox HR.

**Kelly Ostrowski** 10/3/25 9:35 AM
I hear you. Let's take this offline - happy to explain the reasoning in more detail. Can we find 15 min today?

**Priya Patel** 10/3/25 9:36 AM
I don't have 15 minutes. I'll tell my team to do the training after hours.

**Kelly Ostrowski** 10/3/25 9:38 AM
I'd prefer they do it during work hours - asking them to do it on their own time sends the wrong message about our commitment to the training. But if that's the only option that works for your timeline, we can discuss.

**Priya Patel** 10/3/25 9:40 AM
Fine. I'll figure it out.

## October 2025 (later)

**Priya Patel** 10/15/25 2:45 PM
@kelly.o I have a candidate who wants to start Monday. Can we do onboarding faster? The full day thing is too much.

**Kelly Ostrowski** 10/15/25 2:52 PM
Hi Priya - congrats on the hire! The full day onboarding includes required paperwork (I-9, tax forms, etc.) plus benefits enrollment and IT setup. We can compress it but there are certain things that legally need to happen on day 1.

**Priya Patel** 10/15/25 2:54 PM
What if I just have them start coding and they can do paperwork when they have time?

**Kelly Ostrowski** 10/15/25 2:58 PM
Unfortunately the I-9 specifically needs to be completed within 3 days of start, and we need to verify their documents in person (or via authorized representative for remote). Tax forms also need to be done before first paycheck. I can prioritize the legal requirements and push benefits enrollment to later in the week.

**Priya Patel** 10/15/25 3:01 PM
Whatever. Just make it fast. I need them productive.

**Kelly Ostrowski** 10/15/25 3:03 PM
I'll do my best. Can you send me the candidate's info and I'll get everything prepped?

**Priya Patel** 10/15/25 3:15 PM
Sent you the signed offer letter. His name is Xavier Morris.

## November 2025

**Priya Patel** 11/8/25 11:30 AM
@marcus @kelly.o Jason Clark wants to go remote. He's our best engineer. If we lose him because of some policy about being in office, that's on HR.

**Marcus Chen** 11/8/25 11:35 AM
Let's discuss. @kelly.o what's our remote work policy?

**Kelly Ostrowski** 11/8/25 11:42 AM
We don't have a formal written policy. The informal understanding has been:
- Engineering: hybrid (3 days in office) or can request remote case by case
- Sales: mostly in office, some hybrid
- CS: mix based on role
- Exec approval needed for full remote

Jason would need to be approved for full remote. @priya do you support that?

**Priya Patel** 11/8/25 11:44 AM
Of course I support it. He's a 10x engineer. I don't care where he sits.

**Marcus Chen** 11/8/25 11:48 AM
Where would he be located?

**Priya Patel** 11/8/25 11:50 AM
He wants to move to Austin. His wife got a job there.

**Kelly Ostrowski** 11/8/25 11:55 AM
Austin = Texas. We already have one employee in Texas (Alexis Turner). Before we approve this, I need to verify:
1. We're properly registered as an employer in TX
2. Workers' comp coverage extends there
3. Any other compliance issues

I've raised concerns before about our out-of-state compliance. This would be adding another person to a state we may not be properly set up in.

**Priya Patel** 11/8/25 11:58 AM
This is exactly what I mean about HR slowing things down. Jason is going to move whether we approve it or not. Either we figure out the paperwork or we lose him.

**Marcus Chen** 11/8/25 12:05 PM
@kelly.o how long would it take to get set up properly in Texas?

**Kelly Ostrowski** 11/8/25 12:12 PM
I honestly don't know. We'd need to research TX requirements, probably register with the state, extend workers' comp, potentially register for unemployment insurance. Could be a few days to a few weeks depending on what's needed.

Alternatively we could use a PEO or EOR to handle TX compliance. That's faster but costs money.

**Priya Patel** 11/8/25 12:15 PM
This is bureaucracy. Alexis has been in Texas for 2 months with no issues.

**Kelly Ostrowski** 11/8/25 12:18 PM
Alexis being in Texas for 2 months without issues doesn't mean we're compliant - it means we haven't been caught. I've raised concerns about multi-state compliance multiple times.

**Marcus Chen** 11/8/25 12:25 PM
Ok let's take this offline. Kelly, can you put together a memo on what we need to do for Texas specifically? And a timeline? I want to make this work for Jason.

**Kelly Ostrowski** 11/8/25 12:28 PM
Sure, I'll put something together by end of week.

**Priya Patel** 11/8/25 12:30 PM
Let's make sure "end of week" doesn't turn into "end of month." Jason is expecting an answer.

**Kelly Ostrowski** 11/12/25 4:30 PM
@marcus Attached is the Texas compliance memo you requested. Summary: we need to register with TWC, verify workers' comp, and there are some unique TX employment laws to be aware of. Realistically 2-3 weeks to be fully compliant if we do it ourselves, or we could use an EOR for faster turnaround.

**Marcus Chen** 11/12/25 5:15 PM
Thanks Kelly. Let me review and discuss with Priya.

## Kelly's Note

*I never heard back on the Texas thing. I don't know if Jason was approved to go remote or what happened with compliance. This was about a week before I gave notice.*

*Priya and I never really saw eye to eye. She views HR as overhead that slows things down. I tried to explain that compliance isn't optional but she doesn't want to hear it.*

*If Jason did move to Texas and we're not properly set up there, that's now two employees in a state where we may not be compliant. Plus the two in Ohio and one in Illinois.*

*This is a real risk that leadership has consistently deprioritized. Whoever takes over should flag this loudly.*
