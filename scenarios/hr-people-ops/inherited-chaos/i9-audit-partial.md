# I-9 Audit - INCOMPLETE

**Started by:** Kelly Ostrowski
**Date started:** November 20, 2025
**Status:** ABANDONED - Got through first 15 employees before I gave up

---

## Summary

Started auditing I-9 forms in anticipation of the Michigan LEO audit. Found significant issues and stopped because I realized the scope of the problem was bigger than I could handle before my last day.

**Audit Method:**
- Compared employee list to I-9 forms in filing cabinet and Google Drive
- Checked each I-9 for completeness and accuracy
- Noted discrepancies

---

## Findings (Employees E001-E015)

### E001 - Marcus Chen (CEO)
- **Status:** FORM MISSING
- **Notes:** Marcus is a founder. Did anyone ever complete an I-9 for him? I can't find one anywhere. This is embarrassing but also... does the CEO need an I-9? (Yes, Kelly, yes he does.)

### E002 - Priya Patel (CTO)
- **Status:** FORM MISSING
- **Notes:** Same issue as Marcus. No I-9 on file. Founders apparently thought they were exempt. They're not.

### E003 - Aaliyah Washington (Office Manager)
- **Status:** COMPLETE - OKAY
- **Notes:** Form looks good. Passport as List A document. Dated within 3 days of start date. This is how it should be done.

### E004 - James Thompson (Sr. Software Engineer)
- **Status:** COMPLETE - ISSUES
- **Notes:** Section 1 complete. Section 2... the date is weird. Says verified March 1, 2022 but his start date was April 15, 2022. How did we verify his docs before he started? Something's wrong here. Either the date is wrong or we did something weird.

### E005 - Kevin Nguyen (Software Engineer)
- **Status:** COMPLETE - MINOR ISSUES
- **Notes:** Form complete but employer rep signature is illegible. I think it's Marcus's? Should be okay but not ideal.

### E006 - Tanya Robinson (Software Engineer)
- **Status:** COMPLETE - OKAY
- **Notes:** Clean. Used driver's license + Social Security card (List B + C). Properly completed.

### E007 - Miguel Garcia (Backend Developer - REMOTE OHIO)
- **Status:** UNKNOWN
- **Notes:** Cannot locate I-9 form. Miguel is remote in Ohio. I remember Kelly from GreenPath saying something about remote I-9 verification being different? Did we use an authorized representative? If so, where's the documentation? THIS IS A PROBLEM.

### E008 - Damon Williams (CSM)
- **Status:** COMPLETE - ISSUES
- **Notes:** Form exists but Section 2 documents are photocopied and stapled to the I-9. You're not supposed to do that unless specifically required. The documents should be examined and returned to the employee. Also - his EAD was listed as the List A document but there's no receipt number written down.

### E009 - Sarah Anderson (Account Executive)
- **Status:** COMPLETE - OKAY
- **Notes:** Clean. Passport used.

### E010 - David Kim (DevOps Engineer)
- **Status:** COMPLETE - OKAY
- **Notes:** Clean.

### E011 - Brianna Jackson (Marketing Manager)
- **Status:** FORM INCOMPLETE
- **Notes:** Section 1 is complete but Section 2 was never filled out. No documents verified. No employer signature. No date. This form is basically useless. She started January 2023 - we're 2+ years late on this. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

### E012 - Michael Peterson (Account Executive)
- **Status:** COMPLETE - MINOR ISSUES
- **Notes:** Complete but her name is spelled "Michelle" in Section 2 and "Michael" in Section 1. Typo on our part or wrong document? Need to verify.

Wait, is Michael a man or woman? I'm looking at this form and now I'm confused. Checking Gusto... Michael Peterson, male. So Section 2 is wrong. We wrote someone else's name on his I-9 form? What??

### E013 - Jessica Martinez (CSM)
- **Status:** INCOMPLETE
- **Notes:** Section 1 done. Section 2 partially done - document info filled in but no signature or date from employer. Classic "got interrupted and never came back" situation.

### E014 - Terrence Brown (QA Engineer)
- **Status:** COMPLETE - OKAY
- **Notes:** Clean.

### E015 - Cynthia Davis (Support Specialist)
- **Status:** COMPLETE - OKAY
- **Notes:** Clean.

## Where I Stopped

I made it through 15 employees and found:
- 2 completely missing I-9s (founders)
- 1 missing I-9 (remote employee)
- 1 completely incomplete I-9 (Section 2 never done)
- 1 partially incomplete I-9
- 3 with issues/errors that need correction
- 7 that appear compliant

That's a ~47% error rate in my sample.

If that holds for all 47 employees, we could be looking at 20+ I-9 violations.

At $252-$2,507 per violation, that's potentially $5,000 to $50,000 in fines.

I couldn't keep going. I'm sorry.

## Notes on I-9 Rules (for whoever continues this)

**Section 1:** Employee must complete by end of first day of work
**Section 2:** Employer must complete within 3 business days of start date

**List A Documents:** Establish both identity and employment authorization
- U.S. Passport
- Permanent Resident Card
- Employment Authorization Document (EAD)
- Etc.

**List B Documents (Identity):**
- Driver's license
- State ID
- Etc.

**List C Documents (Employment Authorization):**
- Social Security card (unrestricted)
- Birth certificate
- Etc.

**Need List B + List C together, OR just one List A document.**

**Remote Employees:** Can use an "authorized representative" to complete Section 2. This can be anyone - notary, HR professional, employer's agent. MUST be documented. I don't think we've been doing this properly for remote hires.

**Retention:** Keep I-9 for 3 years after hire date OR 1 year after termination, whichever is later.

**Corrections:** You CAN correct errors on I-9s. Draw a line through incorrect info, write correct info, initial and date. For Section 2, use same process. Do NOT use white-out or start new forms for minor corrections.

**Missing I-9s:** This is the big problem. If the I-9 doesn't exist, you can complete a new one with today's date, but this is essentially admitting the violation. You cannot backdate forms. During an audit, a missing or late I-9 is a violation, period.

## What Needs to Happen

1. Complete audit for all 47 employees (I only did 15)
2. For incomplete I-9s: Complete them NOW, with current date, and document why they're late
3. For I-9s with errors: Make corrections following proper protocol
4. For missing I-9s: Complete new I-9s immediately
5. For remote employees: Verify we have proper authorized representative documentation
6. Consider whether to self-report to ICE or wait for audit (ask a lawyer)

## I-9 Forms Location

**Physical forms:** Filing cabinet by Kelly's (my) desk, second drawer, folder labeled "I-9 Forms - CONFIDENTIAL"

**Scanned copies:** Google Drive > HR Shared > I-9 Forms > [subfolders by year]

**Note:** Not all physical forms have been scanned. Not all scanned forms are in the right folders. Some might be in employee personnel folders instead. The organization is... not organized.

*I'm sorry I couldn't finish this. The audit is in 3 weeks and you'll need to move fast.*
