## What Actually Happens

*Real talk from Kelly*

The checklist above is aspirational. Here's what usually happens:

**Day 1:**
- I-9 gets done... usually. Sometimes I forget Section 2.
- Laptop is often NOT ready. IT is one person (well, Aaliyah mostly) and she's busy.
- Benefits overview gets crammed into 15 minutes because we're behind.
- Manager 1:1 happens about 60% of the time on Day 1.
- Company overview? Rarely happens on Day 1. Marcus says he'll do it "later."

**Week 1:**
- Benefits enrollment sometimes happens by Day 5. Sometimes Day 15. Sometimes never until they ask.
- Background check completion varies wildly. Some take 2 days, some take 3 weeks.
- Daily manager check-ins rarely happen. Managers are too busy.

**Day 30/60/90:**
- These check-ins almost never happen. I tried for a while, gave up.

**The result:**
- Everyone has a different onboarding experience
- Key paperwork falls through cracks
- New hires often feel lost their first few weeks
- Managers complain about new hire productivity but don't invest in proper onboarding

**What we need:**
- A real onboarding system (not just a checklist)
- Manager accountability for their part
- Someone dedicated to new hire experience
- Better tools (Rippling? BambooHR? Something that automates reminders)

*This checklist is better than nothing but it's not being followed consistently. Someone needs to fix this.*
