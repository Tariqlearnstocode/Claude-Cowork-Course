# Benefits Enrollment Issues - UNRESOLVED

**Compiled by:** Kelly Ostrowski
**Last updated:** November 2025

---

## Overview

Benefits enrollment has been a mess. We use:
- **Gusto** for payroll and some benefits administration
- **BCBS portal** for health insurance changes
- **Guideline** portal for 401(k)
- **Spreadsheet** to track who enrolled in what (supposed to match Gusto but doesn't)

The problem is that information often doesn't sync, enrollment forms don't get processed, and I've been playing catch-up since I started.

## Known Issues

### 1. Alexis Turner (E038) - Texas Remote Employee

**Issue:** Alexis enrolled in health insurance during onboarding but I'm not sure it processed correctly. She submitted her forms but never got an insurance card.

**Status:** I asked BCBS to verify enrollment. Never heard back. Then I forgot.

**Action needed:** Verify she's actually enrolled. If not, we may owe her reimbursement for any out-of-pocket medical expenses.

**Risk:** Medium - she hasn't complained recently so maybe it's fine?

### 2. Tiffany Morgan (E046) - Declined Benefits

**Issue:** Tiffany declined all benefits when she started. She's part-time (25 hrs/week) so she's not technically eligible for health insurance anyway. BUT she asked about 401(k) participation and I told her she's not eligible as part-time.

**Status:** Actually, I think part-time employees ARE eligible for 401(k) after 90 days. I may have given her wrong information. She's been here 9 months and hasn't enrolled.

**Action needed:** Check 401(k) eligibility rules. If she's eligible, offer her enrollment. We may need to do a correction.

**Risk:** Medium - possible compliance issue with retirement plan discrimination rules.

### 3. Brandon Taylor (E018) - Background Check Flag

**Issue:** Brandon's background check came back with a flag - something about a driving record issue. He's an engineer, doesn't drive for work, but technically our policy says offers are contingent on "successful completion."

**Status:** I decided to let it go since it wasn't relevant to his job. But I never documented that decision. His file just shows "background check pending" because I never marked it complete.

**Action needed:** Document the adjudication decision. Have Marcus sign off retroactively.

**Risk:** Low-medium - if there's ever an issue with Brandon and someone checks his file, it looks like we never finished the background check.

### 4. Destiny Adams (E030) - Incomplete Background Check

**Issue:** Destiny's background check came back asking for more information (previous address verification). I sent her the request but she never responded. And then I forgot to follow up. The background check has been "pending" for 7 months.

**Status:** Incomplete.

**Action needed:** Contact vendor, get status, complete the check, document outcome.

**Risk:** Medium - same as Brandon, but worse because this is legitimately incomplete.

### 5. Open Enrollment 2024 Chaos

**Issue:** During open enrollment last year (for 2025 coverage), we had a technical issue with Gusto. Some employees' elections didn't save properly.

**Status:** I think I fixed it, but at least 3 people complained they were enrolled in the wrong plan. I made manual corrections in BCBS but I don't know if Gusto ever synced.

**Affected employees:**
- Kevin Nguyen (E005) - thought he elected HDHP, ended up in PPO
- Brittany Hall (E023) - added dependent but dependent not showing
- Derek Baker (E031) - no record of election, defaulted to prior year

**Action needed:** Verify all three have correct current coverage. Fix discrepancies.

**Risk:** High for Brittany - if her dependent isn't covered and there's a claim, that's a big problem.

### 6. 401(k) Match Timing

**Issue:** Our 401(k) through Guideline has a 90-day waiting period. I've been tracking eligibility manually but I'm not confident I caught everyone.

**Status:** I think there might be 2-3 people who became eligible and I never enrolled them.

**Action needed:** Pull Guideline records, compare to employee list, verify everyone eligible is enrolled.

**Risk:** High - if we're not contributing matches we promised, that's a fiduciary issue.

---

### 7. COBRA Administration

**Issue:** When employees leave, they're supposed to get COBRA notices. Gusto sends some notices automatically but not all. For the 3 people who left this year, I'm not sure COBRA was handled correctly.

**Former employees 2025:**
- Intern 1 (not eligible - intern)
- Intern 2 (not eligible - intern)
- Intern 3 (not eligible - intern)
- Amy Chen (E-terminated, not in current list) - left August 2025, had health insurance

**Status:** I sent Amy her COBRA paperwork myself, I think. Can't find documentation.

**Action needed:** Verify Amy received COBRA notice. Document.

**Risk:** Medium - COBRA notice failures have penalties ($110/day per affected beneficiary).

---

### 8. Benefits Guide Doesn't Match Reality

**Issue:** We have a "benefits guide" PDF that we give to new hires. It's from 2023 and doesn't match our current offerings.

**Wrong info in guide:**
- Health insurance waiting period (says 60 days, it's 30)
- Company contribution percentages (wrong)
- 401(k) match formula (wrong)
- PTO accrual (says 10 days, we give 15)
- Life insurance amount (says $25K, it's $50K)

**Status:** Every new hire is getting wrong information.

**Action needed:** Update benefits guide. Or delete it and just use Gusto's employee portal.

**Risk:** Medium - employees may have made decisions based on wrong info.

**Timeline:** Open enrollment for 2026 coverage should happen in January-February 2026.

**Status:** Nothing has been prepared. Rates haven't been negotiated. Employee communication hasn't been drafted.

**Tom Brennan called twice in November asking about renewal.** I didn't return the calls.

**Action needed:** Call Tom ASAP. Get 2026 rates. Plan open enrollment.
