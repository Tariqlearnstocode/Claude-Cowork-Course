# State Compliance Questions - UNRESOLVED

**Created by:** Kelly Ostrowski
**Date:** September 2025
**Status:** I asked Marcus about this twice. Never got an answer.

## The Problem

We have employees in 4 states:
- Michigan (headquarters, most employees)
- Ohio (2 employees - Miguel Garcia, Jasmine King)
- Illinois (1 employee - Nicole Harris)
- Texas (1 employee - Alexis Turner)

When you have employees in multiple states, you typically need to:
1. Register as an employer in that state
2. Withhold state income taxes (or not, for Texas)
3. Pay into state unemployment insurance
4. Comply with state-specific employment laws
5. Potentially register for workers' compensation in that state
6. Display required state workplace posters

**I don't know if we've done any of this.**

## Michigan (Home State)

- [x] Registered employer with Michigan Treasury
- [x] Unemployment insurance account active
- [x] Workers' compensation coverage in place
- [x] State income tax withholding set up
- [ ] Required workplace posters displayed? (Need to verify - we moved offices)

**Status:** Probably fine, but verify poster compliance.

## Ohio (2 employees)

**Employees:**
- Miguel Garcia (Backend Developer, since 9/2022, Cleveland area)
- Jasmine King (Software Engineer, since 3/2024, Columbus)

**Questions:**
- [ ] Are we registered with Ohio Department of Taxation?
- [ ] Are we paying Ohio unemployment insurance (ODJFS)?
- [ ] Do we have Ohio workers' comp coverage (BWC)?
- [ ] Are we withholding Ohio state and local taxes correctly?
  - Ohio has complicated local taxes - Cleveland and Columbus both have municipal income taxes
  - Is Gusto handling this automatically?
- [ ] Do we need to display Ohio workplace posters to these employees?

**What I did:**
- I set up Ohio withholding in Gusto for both employees
- Gusto should be handling state taxes
- I THINK Gusto registers you automatically in new states but I'm not 100% sure
- I never confirmed workers' comp coverage

**Risk:** If we're not properly registered, could face back taxes, penalties, and fines. Ohio is fairly aggressive about this.

## Illinois (1 employee)

**Employee:**
- Nicole Harris (Customer Success Manager, since 10/2023, Chicago)

**Questions:**
- [ ] Are we registered with Illinois Department of Revenue?
- [ ] Are we paying Illinois unemployment insurance (IDES)?
- [ ] Do we have Illinois workers' comp coverage?
- [ ] Are we compliant with Illinois employment laws?
  - Illinois has specific requirements around pay transparency, non-competes, etc.
  - They recently passed the Illinois Workers' Rights Amendment - what does that mean for us?
- [ ] Does Nicole need Chicago-specific tax withholding?

**What I did:**
- Set up Illinois withholding in Gusto
- That's it

**Risk:** Same as Ohio. Plus Illinois has strong worker protections and enforces them.

## Texas (1 employee)

**Employee:**
- Alexis Turner (Customer Success Manager, since 11/2024, Austin)

**Questions:**
- [ ] Do we need to register with Texas Workforce Commission?
- [x] Texas has no state income tax - no withholding needed
- [ ] Do we have Texas workers' comp coverage?
  - Texas doesn't require workers' comp but we should probably have it
- [ ] Are there Texas-specific employment law requirements?

**What I did:**
- Verified no state income tax withholding needed
- Added her to Gusto with Texas as her work state
- That's literally it

**Risk:** Texas is relatively employer-friendly but still has requirements. Alexis is our newest remote hire and I did the least due diligence on compliance.

## Other Considerations

### Nexus Issues

Having employees in a state can create "nexus" for:
- **State income tax** - Are we paying state corporate income tax in OH, IL, TX?
- **Sales tax** - If we sell to customers in these states, do we need to collect sales tax?

I mentioned this to Marcus. He said "that's an accounting question, ask the CFO." The fractional CFO said "check with your lawyer." We don't have a lawyer.

### Unemployment Insurance

When employees in other states file unemployment claims, those claims go to their state's unemployment office. If we're not registered, we might:
1. Not get properly notified of claims
2. Face penalties for not paying into the system
3. Have employees denied benefits because our account is invalid

### Workers' Compensation

Each state has different workers' comp rules:
- Michigan: Required, we have it
- Ohio: Required, managed by state fund (BWC)
- Illinois: Required, private insurance market
- Texas: Not required, but highly recommended

**If a remote employee is injured while working (even at home) and we don't have workers' comp coverage in their state, that could be very bad.**

## What I Researched But Couldn't Act On

I found this guidance from a PEO (Professional Employer Organization) we were considering:

> "When you hire your first employee in a new state, you typically need to:
> 1. Register for an employer account with the state tax agency
> 2. Register for state unemployment insurance
> 3. Secure workers' compensation coverage
> 4. Review state-specific employment laws (minimum wage, overtime, leave, etc.)
> 5. Provide required workplace notices/posters
>
> Timeline: Ideally before the employee starts. Realistically, within 30 days."

We did not do this for any of our out-of-state employees. Miguel has been in Ohio for over 3 years.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Audit Gusto settings** - Verify what state registrations Gusto has done on our behalf
2. **Contact a PEO or HR consultant** - Get professional help sorting this out
3. **Retain an employment lawyer** - We need legal advice on our exposure
4. **Workers' comp audit** - Confirm coverage extends to all states where we have employees
5. **Consider a PEO** - A PEO could handle multi-state compliance for us (Justworks, Rippling, TriNet, etc.)

## Why This Wasn't Fixed

- Marcus kept saying "we'll deal with it when we get bigger"
- The cost of a PEO seemed high when we only had 2-3 out-of-state employees
- I didn't have the expertise to do this myself
- By the time it felt urgent, I was already burned out and leaving

*This is probably our biggest compliance exposure outside of I-9s. I'm sorry I couldn't fix it.*
