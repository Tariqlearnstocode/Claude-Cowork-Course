## 3. Employment Policies

### Equal Employment Opportunity
Woodward Ventures is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or any other protected characteristic.

### At-Will Employment
Employment at Woodward Ventures is "at-will." This means either you or the Company may end the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, with or without cause or notice.

### Employment Categories

**Full-Time:** Employees regularly scheduled to work 40 hours per week.

**Part-Time:** Employees regularly scheduled to work fewer than 30 hours per week.

**Exempt:** Salaried employees not eligible for overtime pay under FLSA.

**Non-Exempt:** Hourly employees eligible for overtime pay.

*[Note: We need to review classifications. I'm not confident all CSMs should be exempt. - Kelly]*

### Background Checks
All employment offers are contingent upon successful completion of a background check. Woodward Ventures reserves the right to conduct background checks at any time during employment.

### Immigration Compliance
All employees must provide documentation of their identity and authorization to work in the United States within three days of their start date, as required by federal law (Form I-9).

*[Note: We are NOT consistently doing this. Some people started without completing I-9s for weeks. - Kelly]*

---

## 4. Compensation & Benefits

### Pay Schedule
Employees are paid bi-weekly on Fridays. Direct deposit is required for all employees.

### Salary Reviews
Annual salary reviews typically occur in January, aligned with the company's fiscal year. Raises are not guaranteed and are based on individual and company performance.

*[Note: We've never actually done formal annual reviews. Marcus does ad-hoc raises. - Kelly]*

### Health Insurance
Full-time employees are eligible for health insurance on the first of the month following 60 days of employment.

*[Note: We changed this to 30 days in 2024 but I never updated the handbook. - Kelly]*

We offer:
- Medical: Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO
- Dental: Delta Dental
- Vision: VSP

The company pays 80% of employee premiums and 60% of dependent premiums.

*[Note: Current rates are 75%/50%. Handbook is wrong. - Kelly]*

### 401(k) Retirement Plan
Employees are eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan after 90 days of employment. The company matches 50% of contributions up to 6% of salary (effective 3% match).

*[Note: We actually do a straight 3% match, not 50% of 6%. I need to fix this but don't know the legal implications. - Kelly]*

### Life Insurance
The company provides $25,000 in basic life insurance for all full-time employees at no cost.

*[Note: It's actually $50,000. This was increased in 2024. - Kelly]*

### Additional Benefits
- Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
- Commuter Benefits
- Professional Development Budget: $500/year

*[Note: We increased prof dev to $1,000 in 2025 but employees still think it's $500. - Kelly]*

---

## 5. Time Off & Leave

### Paid Time Off (PTO)
Full-time employees receive 10 days of PTO per year, accruing at 3.33 hours per pay period. PTO may be used for vacation, personal time, or sick leave.

*[Note: We informally changed to 15 days when David joined. Marcus approved verbally but it's not documented. Some employees have 10, some have 15, and no one knows why. - Kelly]*

### Holidays
Woodward Ventures observes the following holidays:
- New Year's Day
- Martin Luther King Jr. Day
- Presidents' Day
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving Day
- Day After Thanksgiving
- Christmas Eve
- Christmas Day

*[Note: This is 10 holidays, which is what we actually do, so this is accurate. - Kelly]*

### Sick Leave
Included in PTO allocation above. Michigan law requires employers to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick time annually. If you have exhausted your PTO, speak with your manager about sick leave accommodations.

*[Note: I don't think our PTO structure actually complies with Michigan ESTA. Need legal review. - Kelly]*

### Parental Leave
Employees who have been with the company for at least 12 months are eligible for up to 6 weeks of paid parental leave following the birth or adoption of a child.

*[Note: Marcus told someone it was 8 weeks. We've never had anyone actually use this so who knows what we'd do. - Kelly]*

### Bereavement Leave
Up to 3 days of paid leave for the death of an immediate family member (spouse, parent, child, sibling).

### Jury Duty
Employees will be paid their regular salary for up to 5 days of jury service.

## 6. Workplace Conduct

### Code of Conduct
All employees are expected to:
- Treat colleagues and customers with respect
- Act with integrity and honesty

- Maintain confidentiality of company information
- Report concerns through appropriate channels

### Anti-Harassment Policy
Woodward Ventures prohibits harassment of any kind, including but not limited to harassment based on sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, or sexual orientation.

If you experience or witness harassment, please report it immediately to your manager or HR.

*[Note: We need to add that employees can also report to Marcus or Priya directly since we don't really have HR (except me, and I'm leaving). - Kelly]*

### Drug and Alcohol Policy
The possession, use, or distribution of illegal drugs on company premises or during work hours is prohibited. Alcohol may be served at company events; employees are expected to consume responsibly.

---

## 7. Safety & Security

### General Safety
All employees are responsible for maintaining a safe work environment. Report any unsafe conditions to the Office Manager immediately.

### Emergency Procedures
Emergency exits are located [TBD - we moved offices].

*[Note: I never filled this in after the move. Fire extinguisher locations should be documented too. - Kelly]*

### Workers' Compensation
If you are injured on the job, report the injury to your manager and HR immediately. Woodward Ventures provides workers' compensation insurance for all employees.

*[Note: We have workers' comp but I'm not sure we have the required postings displayed. Need to check. - Kelly]*

## 8. Technology & Communications

### Company Equipment
Laptops and other equipment provided by the company remain company property. Return all equipment upon separation.

The company reserves the right to terminate employment at any time, with or without cause.

### Final Paycheck
Final paychecks will be issued on the next regular payday following separation.

### Exit Interview

## KELLY'S NOTES - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

Things that need to change in v3.0:

1. Benefits section is almost entirely wrong
2. PTO policy is inconsistent with actual practice
3. Need to add remote work policy - we don't have one
4. Safety section is incomplete
5. Need clearer harassment reporting options
6. Add Michigan-specific leave requirements (ESTA, etc.)
7. Need to verify FLSA compliance language
8. Add acknowledgment process - we don't actually collect these
9. Emergency procedures need updating
10. Add termination procedures for managers

Legal should review before we finalize. We don't have legal.

I told Marcus we need an employment lawyer to review this. He said "it's on the list." That was 8 months ago.
