# Time Tracking Issues

## Current System

Non-exempt (hourly) employees are supposed to track time in Gusto. They clock in/out through the Gusto mobile app or web portal.

**Non-exempt employees:**
- Aaliyah Washington (Office Manager) - $28.50/hr
- Cynthia Davis (Support Specialist) - $24.00/hr
- Lauren Carter (Support Specialist) - $24.00/hr
- Stephanie Moore (SDR) - $22.00/hr
- Jerome Phillips (SDR) - $22.00/hr
- Tiffany Morgan (AP/AR Clerk, PT) - $21.00/hr

## Known Problems

### 1. Inconsistent Clock-In/Out

**Issue:** Employees frequently forget to clock in or out. They then submit "missed punch" requests which I have to approve manually.

**Frequency:** 15-20 missed punch requests per pay period across all hourly employees.

**Risk:** If time records are inaccurate, we could have wage and hour violations. In an audit, auditors may ask employees about their actual hours and compare to our records.

### 2. Meal Break Documentation

**Issue:** Michigan doesn't require meal breaks for adult employees, but we have a policy of a 30-minute unpaid lunch. Gusto is supposed to auto-deduct 30 minutes if someone works 6+ hours.

**Problem:** The auto-deduct sometimes applies when employees work through lunch. At least 3 employees have complained they were shorted time because they ate at their desks but the system still deducted.

**What I did:** I manually adjusted those timesheets but didn't fix the underlying system issue.

**Risk:** If employees are actually working through lunch and not getting paid, that's a wage violation.

### 3. Overtime Tracking

**Issue:** Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime (1.5x) for hours over 40/week.

**Problem:** Cynthia Davis and Lauren Carter (Support Specialists) sometimes work evenings or weekends to cover customer issues. They're supposed to get overtime but:
- They don't always clock the extra hours
- When they do, managers don't always approve it
- There's pressure (unspoken) to "flex" the time instead of reporting OT

**What I found:** Looking at Cynthia's last 3 months, she has 0 overtime hours recorded. But her Slack activity shows her responding to customers at 8-9 PM regularly. Something doesn't add up.

**Risk:** This is a classic wage and hour violation. If employees are working off the clock, we owe them back pay plus penalties.

### 4. The "Exempt Employee Time Tracking" Confusion

**Issue:** Some exempt employees track time for client billing purposes (especially engineers working on custom implementations). This is tracked in a separate spreadsheet, not Gusto.

**Problem:** People confuse "time tracking for billing" with "time tracking for payroll." I've had exempt employees ask me if they need to clock in/out. They don't - but the mixed signals are confusing.

**Other problem:** If we're tracking exempt employees' hours too closely, it could undermine their exempt status. Exempt employees should be managed by results, not hours.

### 5. SDR Classification

**Issue:** Stephanie Moore and Jerome Phillips are classified as non-exempt hourly ($22/hr). But I've seen them working well over 40 hours during busy periods, and their overtime isn't always captured.

**David's response when I raised this:** "Sales is always hustling. It's part of the job."

**My response:** That's not how wage and hour law works.

**Risk:** If SDRs are regularly working 50+ hour weeks but only getting paid for 40, we owe them significant back pay.

## Time Tracking for Remote Employees

**Additional complication:** Our remote employees (Ohio, Illinois, Texas) have different state laws around time tracking, breaks, and overtime.

- **Ohio:** Follows federal FLSA standards, no meal break requirement
- **Illinois:** No meal break requirement for adults, but Chicago has specific rules
- **Texas:** Follows federal FLSA, no additional requirements

**The issue:** Our remote non-exempt employees... wait, do we have any? Let me check...

Looking at the list: Miguel Garcia (OH) and Jasmine King (OH) are engineers (exempt). Nicole Harris (IL) and Alexis Turner (TX) are CSMs (exempt... probably).

So our remote employees are all exempt. That simplifies things, unless the CSM classification is wrong.

## Aaliyah's Special Situation

**Issue:** Aaliyah Washington is our Office Manager. She's been here since the beginning and is non-exempt ($28.50/hr).

**Problem:** Aaliyah works way more than 40 hours. She's often the first one in and last to leave. She manages the office, coordinates IT stuff, helps with HR, handles facilities, and generally keeps the place running.

**Her timesheets:** Show exactly 40 hours every week. I asked her about it once. She said "Marcus told me early on that we couldn't afford overtime, so I just work extra when needed."

**This is illegal.** She's owed overtime for every hour over 40. But she's been here 4 years doing this. The back pay exposure could be massive.

**What I did:** Nothing. I didn't know what to do. I mentioned it to Marcus vaguely and he said "Aaliyah is basically management, she understands." But she's not management - she's non-exempt.

**Risk:** EXTREMELY HIGH. If Aaliyah ever files a wage claim or mentions this in an audit interview, we're in serious trouble.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Audit all non-exempt timesheets** - Compare Gusto time entries to actual work activity (Slack, email, etc.)
2. **Fix meal break auto-deduct** - Either remove it or train employees properly
3. **Reclassify Aaliyah?** - If she's truly doing exempt-level work, promote her to an exempt position. But this doesn't fix the back pay problem.
4. **Train managers on overtime** - They need to understand wage and hour law
5. **Create clear time tracking policy** - Document expectations and consequences

## Questions for Employment Lawyer (if we ever get one)

1. What's our exposure for Aaliyah's unpaid overtime?
2. If we voluntarily pay back wages, does that reduce penalties?
3. How do we fix this going forward without admitting past violations?
4. Should we do a self-audit before the state audit?

*I didn't fix this. I didn't know how. I'm sorry.*
