**Subject:** VP Sales hire - special considerations

Kelly,

Great news - we're hiring David Kowalski as our VP of Sales. He's coming from Procore and is exactly what we need to scale the sales org.

Few things about his offer that are different from standard:
- Salary: $165,000 base + commission (OTE around $260K)
- Start date: March 1
- PTO: He negotiated 20 days (not our standard 10)
- Title: VP of Sales, reporting to me
- Signing bonus: $15,000, paid with first paycheck

Can you make sure all this is reflected correctly in his paperwork? I want his onboarding to be really smooth - first impressions matter.

Thanks,
Marcus

Hi Marcus,

Congratulations on the hire! I'll make sure everything is set up.

A few questions:
1. The 20 days PTO - should I update the offer letter to reflect this? Our template says 10 days.
2. Should we document the signing bonus in a separate agreement, or just include it in the offer letter?
3. Commission plan - do you have the details I should include, or will that be a separate document?

Also, just flagging: our standard offer letter says employees get 10 days PTO. If we're giving David 20 days, that's a 100% increase. Other employees might notice or ask about it. Should we have a talking point ready, or keep his PTO level confidential?

1. Yes, update the offer letter to say 20 days for him
2. Include signing bonus in offer letter
3. Commission plan is still being finalized - just say "per sales compensation plan" or something

Re: other employees - executive comp is always different. If anyone asks, just say executives have different packages. Don't share specifics.

Got it. I'll prepare everything.

One more question - should we update our standard PTO policy? Our handbook says 10 days but informally we've been telling recent hires 15 days. Adding a 20-day executive exception makes it more complex. If we have three different PTO levels (10, 15, 20) with no written policy explaining the tiers, it could look inconsistent if anyone compares.

Just want to flag this as something we should probably clean up at some point.

Good point. Let's revisit the PTO policy after David is onboarded. Put it on the list of things to clean up.

For now, just make David's offer correct and we'll worry about the broader policy later.

Marcus,

Everything is ready for David's start on Monday:

I'll greet him Monday morning and handle paperwork. You're scheduled to meet with him at 10am for welcome/overview.

Let me know if you need anything else.

## Kelly's Notes (handwritten on printed email):

*This is the only documentation of David's 20-day PTO. It's not in any policy document. If he ever asks for verification or if we're audited on our PTO practices, this email chain is all we have.*

*We never did "revisit the PTO policy." It's now been almost 2 years.*

*For tracking purposes:*
- *Standard (handbook says): 10 days*
- *Informal (what we tell new hires): 15 days*
- *David Kowalski (negotiated): 20 days*

*Three different PTO amounts with no written policy explaining why. This is a mess.*

*Also: the signing bonus was paid but I don't think we did proper tax withholding treatment. Signing bonuses are supposed to be withheld at supplemental rate. I set it up as regular pay. Might be a problem? Not sure.*
