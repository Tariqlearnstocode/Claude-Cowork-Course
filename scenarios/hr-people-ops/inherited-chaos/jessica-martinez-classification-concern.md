**Subject:** Question about my job classification

Hi Kelly,

I hope you're doing well! I have a question and wasn't sure who else to ask.

I was talking to a friend who works in HR at another company and she asked if I was exempt or non-exempt. I said I'm salaried so I'm exempt, but then she started asking about my job duties and said it sounded like I might be misclassified?

She said something about how you have to meet certain tests to be exempt, not just be salaried. I looked it up and I'm confused.

I make $68,000/year which she said is above the salary threshold (I think it's around $43,000?). But she said there's also a "duties test" and asked me:
- Do I supervise anyone? (No)
- Do I make decisions that affect the whole company? (No, just my accounts)
- Do I have hiring/firing authority? (No)
- Do I set prices or negotiate contracts? (No, I follow standard pricing)

She said based on that, I might be "non-exempt" which would mean I'm supposed to get overtime when I work more than 40 hours.

I'm not trying to cause problems! I love my job and I'm not unhappy or anything. I just want to make sure everything is correct, especially since I do work a lot of evenings and weekends responding to customer issues.

Can you help me understand this? Am I classified correctly?

Thanks!
Jessica

Hi Jessica,

Thanks for bringing this to my attention. Classification is actually something I've been meaning to review across the company.

You're right that there are tests beyond just salary level. For the "administrative exemption" (which is probably what CSMs would fall under), the job needs to involve:

1. Office or non-manual work related to management or business operations
2. Exercise of discretion and independent judgment on significant matters

It sounds like your friend raised valid questions. Let me look into this and get back to you. I want to make sure we're doing this right.

In the meantime, would you mind keeping track of your hours this week, including any time you spend working evenings or weekends? Just for my reference as I look into this.

I'll follow up soon.

Kelly

Hi Kelly,

Following up on this - did you get a chance to look into it?

I tracked my hours last week like you asked:
- Monday: 9 hours (1 hour after normal hours responding to customer)
- Tuesday: 8.5 hours
- Wednesday: 9.5 hours (stayed late for customer call)
- Thursday: 8 hours
- Friday: 8 hours
- Saturday: 2 hours (urgent customer issue)
- Total: 45 hours

That's 5 hours of overtime if I'm non-exempt. That would be about $48 in overtime pay ($68K / 2080 hours = $32.69/hr, times 1.5 = $49.04 OT rate).

Not trying to be difficult, I just want to understand!

Hi Jessica,

I'm still looking into this. It's a bit complicated and I want to make sure I give you accurate information. Can you give me another week or two?

Thanks for your patience.

Hi Kelly,

Checking in again. I know you're busy but this has been on my mind. My friend (the HR person) said if I'm misclassified, the company could owe me back pay for all the overtime I've worked since I started. I've been here almost 2.5 years and I probably average 3-5 hours of overtime per week.

I did the rough math and it could be a lot of money. I'm not trying to threaten anyone or anything like that, I just want to know what's going on.

Can we schedule a time to talk about this?

Thanks,
Jessica

## Kelly's handwritten notes (on the printed email):

*Meeting with Jessica 10/10:*

*Told her I'm looking into it and will have an answer soon. She seemed satisfied for now but is clearly getting impatient.*

*Talked to Marcus afterward. He said "CSMs have always been exempt, that's how we set it up." I tried to explain the duties test but he said "we're a startup, everyone wears multiple hats, that's just how it is."*

*He asked me to "hold off on making any changes until after the Series A fundraise" because reclassifying people and owing back pay would look bad to investors.*

*I don't think that's legal advice I can follow. But I also don't have the authority to reclassify positions without his approval.*

*Jessica isn't the only CSM who might be misclassified. If she's non-exempt, they probably all are:*
- *Damon Williams - 4+ years, probably significant back pay exposure*
- *Brittany Hall*
- *Destiny Adams*
- *Isabella Sanchez*
- *Nicole Harris (IL - different state laws?)*
- *Alexis Turner (TX - different state laws?)*

*Total exposure if all CSMs are misclassified and we owe 2+ years of OT... I don't even want to calculate it.*

*I need to talk to an employment lawyer. Marcus won't authorize it.*

*11/25 update: Never resolved this. Leaving on 12/1. Someone else's problem now. I'm sorry Jessica.*
