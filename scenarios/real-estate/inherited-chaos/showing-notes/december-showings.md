## Dec 14 - Patels

**Showing:** 4 houses in Birmingham/Bloomfield area

**1. 2847 Buckingham, Birmingham - $395k**
- 3BR/2BA - they need 4BR
- Raj liked layout, Priya said too small
- Schools are great tho
- PASS - wrong bedroom count

**2. 1456 Lakewood, Bloomfield - $415k**
- 4BR/2.5BA - right size!
- Kitchen dated, Priya made a face
- Basement unfinished
- "Maybe" - not excited

**3. 892 Chesterfield, Birmingham - $389k**
- 4BR/2BA
- Great location, walk to downtown
- But... small bedrooms, weird layout
- Raj: "I don't understand this floorplan"
- PASS

**4. 3421 Woodward Heights, Bloomfield Hills - $425k**
- OVER BUDGET but wanted to see it
- 4BR/3BA, beautiful
- Updated everything
- Both loved it
- "If only it was $50k less"

**Notes:** Patels are getting frustrated. Been looking since October. Budget of $400k in Birmingham schools is really tight right now. Might need to expand to Beverly Hills or Bingham Farms? Or stretch budget? Need to have conversation.

**Notes:** These buyers are lukewarm. Been slow to respond, vague about timeline. Might not be ready to buy. Don't invest too much time until they show real commitment.

## Dec 21 - Hendersons (Detailed notes - IMPORTANT)

Met James & Maria Henderson, showed 3 houses:

**1. 2847 Maple St, Royal Oak - $415k** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- 3BR/2BA, 1,650 sqft
- Updated kitchen (they loved it!)
- Original hardwood throughout
- Finished basement = bonus space
- Nice backyard, mature trees
- Walk score 72

Maria: "I can see us living here for 20 years"
James: "It's at the top of our budget..." (hesitant)

**Agent notes:** Maria is emotionally attached. James is the analytical one - worried about finances. This is the dynamic. Need to sell James on the VALUE, not the features.

Listing agent: Mike Tran (I know him)
Listed Dec 5, multiple showings - this won't last

**2. 1523 Oak Hill, Royal Oak - $385k**
- 3BR/1.5BA
- Ranch style (they wanted 2-story)
- Needed updating throughout
- Small kitchen

Both: "It's fine but..." (code for no)
PASS

**3. 892 Normandy Blvd, Ferndale - $399k**
- 3BR/2BA
- Craftsman style, lots of character
- Nice street, walkable to downtown Ferndale
- Galley kitchen (Maria didn't like)

Maria: "I like it but it's not THE one"
James: "Good price though"

**My read:** Maple house is the one. But James needs convincing on price. Offered to bring in parents for second showing.

**Follow-up:** They want to show parents on Sunday 12/22. Set it up.

## Dec 27 - Sarah Mitchell (Zillow lead)

**No showing** - Just initial consult call

- First time buyer
- Budget $280-340k
- Wants Ferndale specifically
- Pre-approved? Said yes but didn't have letter
- "Ready to move fast"

**My read:** Sounds motivated but need to verify pre-approval. Could be great lead or could be tire kicker. Schedule showing to test seriousness.

**Action:** Get pre-approval letter, then set showings for first week of January
