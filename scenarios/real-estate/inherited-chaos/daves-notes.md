## Undated - probably December

### Quick reminders

- Call Patel back about the inspection
- Hendersons want to see the Maple house again - Saturday??
- WHY won't Mike Tran return my calls
- Get Joyce her comps - promised by Thursday which Thursday tho
- Birmingham showing moved to 2pm or was it 2:30
- URGENT: Chen counteroffer expires 5pm Friday

---

## Dec 18 (I think)

Marcus needs the Fitzgerald docs. Told him I'd have them by EOD. Where did I put the sellers disclosure??

The Okonkwo deal is falling apart. Buyers found something in the inspection - roof maybe? Or was it the foundation? Either way they want $15k credit. Sellers won't do more than $8k. Need to get everyone on a call.

Greenfield listing needs price reduction. Told the Millers I'd bring comps but they're going to fight me on it. Listed at $425k, should be $399k MAX. Been sitting 67 days.

---

## Dec 19

Jordan Kim closing scheduled for Jan 8th. Title company confirmed. Buyers need to do final walkthrough - schedule with Marcus

Voicemail from that Zillow lead - the one looking in Ferndale. Said her name was Sarah? Or Sandra? Check CRM. She sounded motivated.

REMINDER: Get holiday cards to:
- The Nguyens (closed in March)
- Patterson referral
- Jennifer Liu (pending)

Wait did I already send the Liu card?

---

## Dec 20

Pre-approval came through for the Washingtons - $485k. They want to see the Royal Oak house and something in Berkley. Pull listings tomorrow.

Listing appointment with the Chens - 47892 Woodward Hills Dr, Bloomfield. Big one. Estate sale, been in family 40 years. Emotional clients. Daughter Helen is the decision maker but son wants to be involved. Tread carefully.

Spoke to Brian at Title One about the Rodriguez closing. Feb 3 is tight but doable if we get docs by the 15th.

---

## Dec 21 (Saturday)

Showed the Hendersons three houses:
1. 2847 Maple - they LOVED it. Want to come back with parents tomorrow
2. 1523 Oak - too small, pass
3. 892 Normandy - liked but "not the one"

Maple house has another showing Monday. If Hendersons want it they need to move fast. Told them to sleep on it and call me tomorrow AM.

---

## Dec 22

Hendersons didn't call. Left voicemail.

Marcus said the Fitzgerald appraisal came in low - $342k vs $365k purchase price. Ugh. Buyers want renegotiation, sellers are pissed. This is going to blow up.

Sandra asked about the Chen listing. I haven't even sent the CMA yet. Holidays are killing me.

---

## Dec 23

CLOSING DAY: Thompson @ 10am - Title One downtown
Everything should be ready. Marcus confirmed wire instructions went out.

Left for holidays after closing. Will check email but taking a few days.

---

## Dec 26

247 emails. Kill me.

Urgent stuff:
- Fitzgerald buyers sent termination threat. Appraisal issue unresolved.
- Mike Tran FINALLY responded - he's got buyers for the Greenfield listing. Showing Tuesday.
- Helen Chen asking where the CMA is. I said after Christmas. Need to do this TODAY.
- Sarah/Sandra Zillow lead followed up twice. Definitely motivated.

Hendersons still haven't called back about Maple house. Bad sign.

---

## Dec 27

Fitzgerald deal: Proposed split-the-difference at $353,500. Sellers countered at $358k. Buyers said $350k or they walk. We're $8k apart. Someone needs to move.

Chen CMA: Comparable sales suggest $1.1-1.2M. House needs work though. Will recommend $1.15M but expect pushback.

Washington showing cancelled - she's sick. Rescheduled for... when? Check calendar.

---

## Dec 28

Mike Tran's buyers want to make an offer on Greenfield!!! $389k. This could work. Finally.

Sent to Millers. They want $405k minimum. I told them that's not happening. They said they'd "think about it."

Called Hendersons again. Voicemail. This is dead, isn't it?

---

## Dec 29

New lead from Ford relocation program - couple moving from Texas, need to buy by Feb 28. Budget $550k. Looking in Troy/Rochester Hills area. Name is... I wrote it somewhere... Rodriguez? No that's the other deal. Martinez?

Sent them some listings. Need to schedule video call to narrow down.

---

## Dec 30

Fitzgerald sellers finally agreed to $353,500. Buyers accepted. Crisis averted. Closing still on track for Jan 15.

Millers came back: $395k minimum on Greenfield. Mike Tran's buyers are at $392k final. We're $3k apart. Just split the difference people!!

Sandra wants a year-end summary. LOL. Maybe tomorrow.

---

## Dec 31

Happy New Year eve. Quick check:

Active buyers:
- Hendersons - probably dead but try one more time
- Washingtons - rescheduled to Jan 4
- Martinez relocation - video call Jan 2
- Sarah Zillow - need to follow up
- Patels? Are they still looking or did I close them out?
- Kim family (not Jordan Kim, different Kims) - wanted Royal Oak under $350k

Active sellers:
- Greenfield Millers - deal pending if they stop being difficult
- Chen estate - CMA done, meeting after New Year

- Jordan Kim - closing Jan 8
- Rodriguez - closing Feb 3
- Thompson - CLOSED Dec 23
- Liu - closing... Jan something?
- Okonkwo - is this still happening?

---

## Jan 1

Not working today.

Well, one quick email. Two emails. Fine, three.

---

## Jan 2 (Thursday)

Martinez video call went well. Nice couple. Mid-30s, two kids (8 and 5), work-from-home wife needs office space, husband commutes to Ford Dearborn. They like Troy but open to Rochester. Set up showings for Saturday.

Also: formal complaint email from Jennifer Liu. Says she hasn't heard from me in 2 weeks and closing is supposedly Jan 10 and she doesn't know what's happening. That's fair. I dropped the ball. Apologized and sent update.

Wait - Liu closing is Jan 10? That's 8 days. What still needs to happen?

---

## Jan 3 (my last day - didn't know it yet)

Morning: Karen called at 7am. She's going into surgery Monday. Non-emergency but still. She needs me home.

Told Sandra. She understood.

I should make a list for whoever takes over but... I don't even know where to start. There's so much. It's all in my head.

Here's what I can remember:

CLOSING THIS MONTH:
1. Jordan Kim - Jan 8 - should be ready, talk to Marcus
2. Jennifer Liu - Jan 10 - behind on something, can't remember what
3. Fitzgerald - Jan 15 - done, just needs to close
4. Rodriguez - technically Feb 3 but financing deadline is soon

PENDING BUT NOT CLOSING YET:
- Greenfield listing with offer pending (Millers)
- Chen estate listing (need to present CMA and sign)
- Something else I'm forgetting

ACTIVE LEADS:
- Too many. Check CRM. Sorry.

God, I'm abandoning these people. Sandra will figure it out.
