## Outstanding Items

### CRITICAL: Rate Lock
The Rodriguez's interest rate is locked at 6.875% and **expires February 1, 2025**. If closing slips past Feb 3, they'll need a rate lock extension which costs money OR they'll get a higher rate.

**Action needed:** Confirm with Tom Wilson at Flagstar that everything is on track for the rate lock deadline.

### Inspection
- Due by January 28
- NOT YET SCHEDULED
- Need to get this on the calendar ASAP - we're already in January

### Appraisal
- Due by January 20
- Should be ordered by lender - verify with Tom Wilson
- FHA appraisals can take longer, so this is time-sensitive

### Loan Documents
- FHA loans require more documentation
- Rodriguez's provided everything as of Dec 15
- Confirm with lender nothing else is needed

## Notes

- Carlos works nights at FedEx - best time to reach him is 2-5pm
- Elena handles most of the paperwork/logistics
- They have two kids (10 and 7) - need to close before school starts back
- First-time homebuyers, nervous about the process
- FHA loan = more paperwork, more inspections possible

## Concerns

1. **Rate lock timing is tight** - Zero room for delay
2. **Inspection not scheduled** - This should have been done by now
3. **FHA appraisal** - Can be picky, might require repairs before closing
4. **Haven't heard from lender recently** - Need status update

## My Assessment

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
**Likelihood of Closing on Time:** 75%

This deal is more fragile than it looks. The rate lock deadline creates real pressure, and we're behind on the inspection. Need to get things moving immediately.

## TO DO IMMEDIATELY

1. Call Tom Wilson - verify appraisal ordered, confirm loan status
2. Schedule inspection - Jan 28 deadline is coming fast
3. Call Elena Rodriguez - update her on status, reassure her
4. Check with Angela Kim (listing agent) - any seller issues?
