## Outstanding Items

1. **FINAL WALKTHROUGH** - Not scheduled yet! This needs to happen Tuesday Jan 7. Contact Jordan and Derek to arrange. Usually seller vacates the day before and we do walkthrough that evening.

2. **Wire Transfer** - Jordan should initiate by Monday Jan 6 at latest. Cash to close is $87,234. Confirm he's done this!

3. **Photo ID** - Remind Jordan to bring valid driver's license to closing

4. **Utilities** - Remind Jordan to transfer utilities effective Jan 8

## Notes

- Jordan is organized and responsive - easy client
- This has been a smooth transaction from day one
- Sellers moved out Dec 28 (early) - house should be ready
- Jordan is excited - first home, worked hard to save for it
- Don't forget champagne at closing (Dave always does this)

## My Assessment

**Risk Level:** VERY LOW
**Likelihood of Closing:** 99%

Everything is ready. Just needs the walkthrough scheduled and wire initiated. This should be an easy closing.

## URGENT: CLOSING IS IN 2 DAYS

- Walkthrough: MUST SCHEDULE TODAY
