## The Appraisal Issue

The appraisal came in at $342,000 - a full $23,000 below the purchase price of $365,000.

**What happened:**
- Buyers wanted to renegotiate to appraised value ($342k)
- Sellers furious, threatened to cancel
- I proposed split the difference: $353,500
- After much back and forth, both parties agreed on December 30

**Loan impact:**
- Original loan was based on $365k purchase / $292k loan
- New loan based on $353,500 purchase / $283,000 loan
- Buyers actually save on down payment

**Current status:**
- Price amendment signed by both parties
- Lender reprocessing with new numbers
- Closing date held at January 15

## Outstanding Items

1. **Final Loan Commitment** - Should come from Ryan Peters by Jan 8. Follow up if not received.

2. **Final Walkthrough** - Needs to be scheduled. Typically day before or morning of closing. Fitzgeralds are flexible.

3. **Closing Disclosure** - Title company sends 3 days before closing. Should arrive by Jan 10.

4. **Wire Instructions** - Brian at Title One will send. Remind Fitzgeralds about wire fraud warnings.

## Notes

- Michael and Amanda are first-time buyers, very anxious about the process
- The appraisal issue really stressed them out - I spent a lot of time calming them down
- Susan (listing agent) was difficult during renegotiation but we got it done
- This should be a smooth closing now that the price issue is resolved
- Don't forget to remind them about utilities transfer

## My Assessment

**Risk Level:** LOW
**Likelihood of Closing:** 95%

This deal is essentially done. Just need to confirm final loan approval and schedule the walkthrough. Barring any last-minute surprises, this closes January 15.
