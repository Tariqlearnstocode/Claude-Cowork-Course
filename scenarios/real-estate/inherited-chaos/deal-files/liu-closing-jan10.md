## THE PROBLEM

Based on Jennifer's emails, there are two issues holding up this closing:

### 1. Employment Verification
The lender needs a verbal employment verification (VOE) from Jennifer's HR department. Apparently this was requested earlier but never completed?

**What needs to happen:**
- Jennifer's HR needs to receive a call from the lender verifying employment
- Jennifer may need to provide HR contact info to the lender
- This should be quick once initiated

**Who dropped the ball?** Unclear. Dave's last email (Jan 2) said he'd "send instructions" but I don't see them.

### 2. Roof Repair Verification
The sellers agreed to a $2,500 credit for roof repairs, BUT the contract language says they would complete repairs before closing and provide receipts.

**What needs to happen:**
- Get receipts from sellers showing roof repair completed
- If repairs NOT done, need to negotiate (maybe convert to credit at closing?)
- Deadline for this is January 7 (3 days away!)

**Who dropped the ball?** Dave was supposed to coordinate with Steve Park (listing agent) but there's no documentation that he did.

## Client State

Jennifer is STRESSED. She sent multiple emails and texts over the holidays with no response. Her last email (Jan 2) threatened to escalate to Sandra.

She has:
- Already given notice to her landlord
- Parents flying in Jan 11 to help her move
- No backup plan if closing doesn't happen

Dave responded on Jan 2 and apologized, but did he actually fix anything? UNCLEAR.

## Notes

- Jennifer is detail-oriented and organized - she's not the problem
- The sellers have been cooperative (agreed to repairs)
- Steve Park (listing agent) is responsive when contacted
- This closing was smooth until the last few weeks

## CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS

**TODAY (Monday Jan 6):**
1. Call Chris Taylor at Rocket Mortgage - status of loan, employment verification
2. Call Steve Park - status of roof repairs and receipts
3. Call Jennifer - apologize, explain transition, reassure her
4. Confirm closing disclosure will be sent TODAY (legally required 3 days before)

**By Wednesday Jan 8:**
- Employment verification completed
- Roof repair verification completed or alternative agreed
- Clear to close obtained

**Thursday Jan 9:**
- Final walkthrough (schedule this NOW)
- Wire transfer initiated

**Friday Jan 10:**
- CLOSING at 3pm

## My Assessment

**Risk Level:** HIGH
**Likelihood of Closing on Time:** 60%

This closing is in serious jeopardy. There are multiple balls in the air and only 4 days to catch them all. Best case: everything gets resolved and we close Friday. Worst case: closing gets pushed and Jennifer loses trust (and maybe the deal).

## ESCALATION

If this can't be resolved by Tuesday, may need to involve Sandra (broker) to help navigate. This is exactly the kind of situation that damages the agency's reputation.
