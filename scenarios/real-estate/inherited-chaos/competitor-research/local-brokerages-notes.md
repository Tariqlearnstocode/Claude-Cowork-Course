# Local Brokerage Research Notes

*Dave's notes on competitors - found in desk drawer*

## Max Broock Realtors

**Market position:** Premium/luxury focused
**Strengths:**
- Strong Birmingham/Bloomfield presence
- Excellent marketing materials
- Agent training program
- Name recognition with affluent buyers

**Weaknesses:**
- Higher fees/splits for agents
- Less personal service (big machine)
- Don't do much below $400k

**Agents to watch:**
- Sarah Mitchell (not MY Sarah Mitchell lead - different person) - does lots of Birmingham
- Tom Harrison - relocation specialist, competes for Ford/GM clients

**Notes:** They're not really our competitor except at the high end. Chen estate listing is in their territory though - if we price wrong, sellers might move to Max Broock.

## The Real Competition

Honestly, our real competition isn't other brokerages. It's:

1. **Zillow/Redfin** - Buyers think they don't need agents. They're wrong, but convincing them takes work.

2. **Discount brokerages** - 1% listing services. They save sellers money but provide less service. We need to prove our value.

3. **iBuyers** (Opendoor, etc.)** - Less presence in Detroit but growing. Sellers like the convenience even if they get less money.

4. **For Sale By Owner** - Always a thing. Usually come to us eventually.

## What Sets Us Apart

When someone asks "why Lakefront?"

1. **Local expertise** - We actually live here, not just work here
2. **Personal service** - You get ME, not a team of juniors
3. **Honesty** - I'll tell you if your house is overpriced (looking at you, Millers)
4. **Network** - 20+ years of relationships with lenders, inspectors, contractors
5. **Sandra's training** - Our agents know what they're doing

## Ford Relocation Notes

Ford relocation program is GOLD. Steady stream of qualified buyers with real money and tight timelines.

**Who has it:**
- Us (me specifically - I've done 30+ Ford relocations)
- Max Broock has some
- A few solo agents with relationships

**How we keep it:**
- Deliver results
- Make HR's life easy
- Don't screw up

**Martinez is a Ford relocation** - need to knock it out of the park. Ford HR will hear about it either way.
