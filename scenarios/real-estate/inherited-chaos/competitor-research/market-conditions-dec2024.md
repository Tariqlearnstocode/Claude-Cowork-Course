# Metro Detroit Real Estate Market - December 2024

*Dave's market summary notes*

---

## The Big Picture

**Interest Rates:** ~7% for 30-year conventional
- Up from 6.5% in September
- Buyers are rate-sensitive
- Every 0.5% increase = ~6% less buying power

**Inventory:** Still low, but improving
- More listings than 2023
- Still below 2019 levels
- Desirable areas (Royal Oak, Ferndale, Birmingham) move fast
- Less desirable areas sitting longer

**Buyer Sentiment:** Cautious
- Waiting for rates to drop
- Fear of buying at the "wrong time"
- First-timers especially nervous

**Seller Sentiment:** Unrealistic
- Still thinking it's 2022
- Overpricing is epidemic
- Won't accept that the market has shifted

## What I'm Telling Clients

### Buyers:
- Don't try to time the market
- Rates may drop in 2025, but so might inventory
- Buy when you're ready, refinance later
- Get pre-approved NOW
- Be decisive - good houses go fast

### Sellers:
- You're not in 2022 anymore
- Price to market, not to your dream number
- First 2 weeks are critical - don't waste them overpriced
- Listen to your agent (me)
- Days on market is a stigma

---

## Predictions for 2025

- Rates might drop to 6-6.5% if Fed cuts
- If rates drop, buyer demand spikes, prices go up
- Inventory might increase slightly (people waiting to list)
- Detroit-specific: Auto industry stable, tech presence growing
- Best time to buy might be early 2025 before spring rush

## Current Active Market Notes

**Martinez relocation:** $500-550k in Troy/Rochester is achievable but competitive. Need to move fast when we find the right one.

**Patels:** $400k in Birmingham schools is tough. Might need to expand search or increase budget.

**Hendersons:** $415k for Maple house is fair. They should buy it before it's gone.

**Chen estate:** $1.15M for dated Bloomfield Hills is right. David is wrong about $1.3M.

**Greenfield (Millers):** $392k offer is a GIFT after 67 days. Take it.
