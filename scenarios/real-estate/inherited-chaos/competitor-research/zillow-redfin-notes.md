# Zillow & Redfin: Friend or Foe?

*Dave's thoughts on the tech disruption*

---

## The Reality

These platforms aren't going away. Need to work with them, not against them.

**Zillow:**
- Where most buyers start their search
- Zestimates are often wrong (use this!)
- Lead generation can work (see: Sarah Mitchell lead)
- Premier Agent program = pay to play

**Redfin:**
- Lower commission model
- Salaried agents = less motivated?
- Good technology
- Appeals to DIY-minded buyers

---

## How They Hurt Us

1. **Buyers think they don't need agents**
   - "I can find houses online"
   - Don't understand what we actually do
   - Undervalue negotiation, process management, local knowledge

2. **Sellers get unrealistic expectations**
   - Zestimate says $450k, I say $400k
   - "But Zillow says..."
   - Have to educate constantly

3. **Lead quality varies**
   - Some Zillow leads are serious
   - Many are just browsing
   - Takes time to qualify

---

## How They Help Us

1. **More informed clients**
   - Already narrowed preferences
   - Know neighborhoods they want
   - Done preliminary research

2. **Zillow leads work**
   - Sarah Mitchell came from Zillow
   - If you respond fast, can convert
   - Better than cold calling

3. **Market data**
   - Good for showing trends
   - Can reference in client conversations
   - "Even Zillow says..."

## My Zillow Strategy

1. **Respond to leads within 5 minutes**
   - Seriously. Speed matters.
   - First agent to respond usually wins
   - I have notifications on my phone

2. **Don't bash the Zestimate**
   - Instead: "Let me show you the actual comps"
   - Be educational, not dismissive
   - People trust data

3. **Show value early**
   - What do I know that Zillow doesn't?
   - Local insight, off-market opportunities
   - Process expertise
   - Negotiation skills

4. **Convert online to in-person**
   - Get them in the car for showings
   - Relationship builds from there
   - Hard to fire someone you've spent 3 hours with

## Redfin Specifically

Not a huge presence in Detroit yet, but growing.

**Their pitch:** "Lower commission, same service"

**The reality:**
- You get a salaried agent who handles volume
- Less personal attention
- Fine for straightforward deals
- Falls apart when things get complicated

**How to compete:**
- Emphasize personal service
- Track record of handling tough situations
- "I'm not handing you off to a team"
- Local expertise vs. national algorithm

---

## The iBuyer Threat

Opendoor, Zillow Offers (defunct), etc.

**Their pitch:** "Sell your house instantly, skip the hassle"

**The reality:**
- They pay below market (usually 5-10% less)
- Convenience comes at a price
- Less presence in Detroit than Sun Belt

**How to counter:**
- Do the math for sellers
- "You're leaving $20k on the table for convenience"
- Some sellers still choose convenience
- Don't be judgmental - respect their choice

## Bottom Line

The industry is changing. Agents who adapt survive. Agents who complain about Zillow will get left behind.

My approach:
- Use these tools, don't fight them
- Add value that algorithms can't
- Be faster, smarter, more personal
- Prove ROI at every step

## Sarah Mitchell Notes

Zillow lead, came in Dec 26

- First time buyer
- Ferndale focus
- $280-340k budget
- "Ready to move fast" (they all say this)

Need to verify pre-approval before investing time. If real, could close in Q1.

Did I follow up on this?? Check CRM.
