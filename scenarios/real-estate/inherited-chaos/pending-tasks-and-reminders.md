"Stop saying yes to everything"

"CRM, Dave. USE THE CRM."

"The Hendersons are not going to call you back"

"Liu deal almost fell apart because you didn't respond to emails. Don't do this again."

"Karen wants more time together. She's right."

## Final Note (Jan 3, morning)

Everything above is a mess. I know it's a mess. I kept meaning to organize it and never did.

If you're reading this, you're probably trying to figure out what I left behind. I'm sorry.

The most urgent things:
1. Jordan Kim closes Wednesday
2. Jennifer Liu closes Friday (and she's angry)
3. Martinez showings are Saturday
4. Everything else... prioritize by closing date and deal size

Good luck.

- Dave
