## Voicemail 2
**From:** Jennifer Liu (248-555-0198)
**Date:** Friday, January 3, 2025 - 4:15 PM
**Duration:** 1:12

"Dave, it's Jennifer Liu again. I... okay, I'm trying not to be that client but this is really stressful. I just got off the phone with the lender and they're saying they still don't have the employment verification and something about repair documentation? I close in a week and I have no idea what's happening.

Please, please call me back. Or text me. Or email. Something. I've already given notice to my landlord and my parents have plane tickets.

[pause]

I'm sorry, I know you're probably busy. I'm just really scared this isn't going to happen. Please call me. Thanks."

## Voicemail 3
**From:** Helen Chen (313-555-0187)
**Date:** Friday, January 3, 2025 - 5:30 PM
**Duration:** 0:52

"Hi Dave, Helen Chen. I was expecting to hear from you about the CMA - you said you'd have it by Monday, which was... last Monday. I understand it's been the holidays but David is getting impatient and I need to show him the numbers before he does something stupid like call another agent.

Can you send over whatever you have, even if it's not finished? I can work with preliminary numbers. Thanks. Call me."

## Voicemail 4
**From:** Mike Tran (248-555-0156)
**Date:** Friday, January 3, 2025 - 6:02 PM
**Duration:** 0:45

"Hey Dave, Mike Tran. Quick question - did you get the purchase agreement I sent for Greenfield? I emailed it New Year's Eve but haven't gotten signatures back. My buyers are getting antsy. They want to know if the deal is actually happening or if they should keep looking.

Let me know. Also - heads up, the Maple house got an offer. Don't know if your Henderson people are still interested but... clock's ticking. Talk soon."

## Voicemail 5
**From:** Christina Martinez (469-555-0135)
**Date:** Saturday, January 4, 2025 - 8:15 AM
**Duration:** 1:05

"Good morning Dave, this is Christina Martinez. Victor and I are on our way to the airport - we land in Detroit around noon.

Just wanted to confirm our showings today - 10am start at the Brookdale house in Troy, right? Victor has the schedule you sent.

Also, I looked up that Meadowbrook house again online and it shows 'contingent' now? Does that mean someone made an offer? I really loved that one from the photos. Hopefully we can still see it?

See you at 10! Oh, our phone numbers are... well, you have them. Call us if anything changes. Bye!"

## Voicemail 6
**From:** Maria Henderson (248-555-0135)
**Date:** Saturday, January 4, 2025 - 11:30 AM
**Duration:** 0:41

"Hi Dave, it's Maria Henderson. I know we've been hard to reach and I'm sorry about that - it's been a crazy couple of weeks with James's mom.

I saw online that the Maple house has a pending offer now. I guess we missed it. [sigh] I knew we should have moved faster.

Anyway, if it falls through or if you have anything else similar, let us know. James is finally ready to be serious. Too little too late, I guess. Thanks Dave."

## Voicemail 7
**From:** Tom Wilson, Flagstar Bank (313-555-0156)
**Date:** Monday, January 6, 2025 - 8:03 AM
**Duration:** 0:55

"Dave, Tom Wilson at Flagstar. Calling about the Rodriguez loan. We need to get the appraisal ordered ASAP - I'm showing it hasn't been done yet and we've got the appraisal contingency deadline on the 20th. Also need to schedule the inspection before the 28th.

I know you're probably swamped after the holidays but this file is going to get tight if we don't move on it. The rate lock expires February 1st and I don't want to have that conversation with your clients.

Call me back today please. Thanks."

## Voicemail 8
**From:** Joyce Brennan (313-555-0145)
**Date:** Monday, January 6, 2025 - 8:45 AM
**Duration:** 0:35

"Dave, Joyce Brennan. You promised me comps for Huntington Woods three weeks ago. I've been very patient but at some point I need to either work with you or find someone else. I'm not in a huge rush but I'd at least like to know if you're still interested in my listing.

Please call me today. Thank you."

## Voicemail 9
**From:** Priya Patel (248-555-0168)
**Date:** Monday, January 6, 2025 - 9:15 AM
**Duration:** 1:22

"Hi Dave, Priya Patel. Raj and I have been talking and... honestly, we're getting pretty discouraged. We've been looking since October and nothing fits our budget in Birmingham schools.

Raj thinks maybe we need to increase our budget to $450k, but I'm not sure we're comfortable with that. Or maybe we should look at different areas? I don't know.

Can we schedule a call to talk through our options? I feel like we're stuck and I don't know how to get unstuck. We really want to move before the next school year.

Thanks Dave. Hope you had a good holiday."

**Date:** Monday, January 6, 2025 - 9:30 AM
**Duration:** 0:28

"Hi, this is Sandra calling for... [pause] wait, is this Dave's line still? I thought we forwarded this. Jessica, if you're checking Dave's voicemail, give me a call. We need to go over the pipeline today. Thanks."
