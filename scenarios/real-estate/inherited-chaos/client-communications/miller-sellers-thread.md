## Text Messages with Gerald Miller

**November 14, 2024**

**Dave (2:30 PM):** Gerald, we've had 12 showings and no offers. The feedback is consistent - buyers think we're priced too high for the condition. I'd recommend reducing to $399k to generate more interest.

**Gerald (3:15 PM):** $399k??? That's $25k less than we listed. No way. Maybe $415k but that's as low as I'll go.

**Dave (3:20 PM):** I understand. Let's try $415k and see what happens. I'll update the listing today.

**December 10, 2024**

**Gerald (9:45 AM):** Dave any updates? Been another month. Nothing happening.

**Dave (10:30 AM):** I know, it's frustrating. We've had 6 more showings since the price reduction but still no offers. The market is telling us something.

**Gerald (10:45 AM):** The market is wrong. This house is worth $420k easy. My neighbor sold his for $430k two years ago.

**Dave (11:00 AM):** That was a different market - rates were 3.5% then, now they're 7%. Buyers can afford less. I really think we need to get to $399k or lower.

**Gerald (11:15 AM):** Dorothy says we should try a different agent.

**Dave (11:22 AM):** I understand the frustration. Let me see if I can generate some new interest. I have a contact at another agency who works with a lot of buyers in this area.

**Dave (3:45 PM):** Gerald - good news! I have a buyer interested in Greenfield. He's offering $389k. I know that's below where you want to be, but it's a real offer with financing in place.

**Gerald (4:30 PM):** $389k is an insult. Tell them $410k.

**Dave (4:35 PM):** I'll counter, but they're not going to $410k. What's your absolute bottom line? I need to know where you can actually land.

**Gerald (4:52 PM):** Fine. $400k. But that's it.

**Dave (5:10 PM):** I'll see what I can do.

**December 29, 2024**

**Dave (11:00 AM):** They came back at $392k. Said that's their max. Can you do $395k and meet in the middle?

**Gerald (11:45 AM):** Dorothy wants to think about it.

**Dave (12:30 PM):** I understand. But these buyers are looking at other properties. If we don't respond today, they may move on.

**Gerald (2:15 PM):** $395k. Final answer. Dorothy agrees.

**Dave (2:20 PM):** Great! I'll present the counter. Cross your fingers.

**December 30, 2024**

**Dave (10:15 AM):** They countered at $393k. We're $2k apart. I really think you should take it. This is the only offer we've had in 67 days.

**Gerald (10:45 AM):** $393k? Just $2k more and they won't do it? That's ridiculous.

**Dave (10:50 AM):** I know it feels that way, but sometimes buyers have firm limits. My recommendation is to accept. You can always counter back at $394k and split the difference if you want.

**Gerald (11:30 AM):** Let me talk to Dorothy tonight. We'll decide by tomorrow.

**Dave (11:35 AM):** Sounds good. Just remember - a bird in hand...

---

**December 31, 2024**

**Gerald (9:00 AM):** Ok $393k. We'll take it. Let's get this done.

**Dave (9:15 AM):** Great decision! I'll let the buyer's agent know and get the paperwork started. Happy New Year - this is a good way to end the year!

**Gerald (9:20 AM):** Happy new year. Just glad this is almost over.

Dave,

Great news! My buyers are thrilled. I'll have the purchase agreement updated with the $393k price and send over for signatures by end of day.

Proposed timeline:
- Inspection: Within 10 days (by Jan 10)
- Financing contingency: 21 days (by Jan 21)
- Closing: Feb 15

Let me know if that works for your sellers.

Happy New Year!
Mike

Mike,

Timeline looks good. Send the PA over and I'll get signatures.

Thanks for working with me on this one. The Millers have been... challenging. I'm glad we could make it work.

Happy New Year,
Dave
