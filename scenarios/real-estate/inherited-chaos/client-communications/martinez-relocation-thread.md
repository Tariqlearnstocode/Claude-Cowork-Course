**Subject:** Welcome to Michigan! Let's find your new home

Victor,

Welcome! Ford Relocation Services connected us, and I'm looking forward to helping your family find the perfect home in the Detroit area.

I've been working with Ford relocations for over 15 years, so I understand the timeline pressures and what families typically need when moving to Michigan.

A few questions to help me prepare:
1. Have you visited the Troy/Rochester Hills area before?
2. What's most important to your family - commute time, schools, neighborhood feel, or something else?
3. Does your spouse work outside the home, and if so, where would she be commuting?
4. Any dealbreakers I should know about?

I'd love to schedule a video call before your trip so we can hit the ground running. Would January 2nd work for a 30-minute call?

Looking forward to working with you!

Dave,

Thanks for the quick response! Excited to get started.

To answer your questions:
1. Never been to Michigan actually - this will be our first visit
2. Schools are #1 priority. Our daughter is 8 and gifted - we want a district that can challenge her. Son is 5, starting kindergarten next fall.
3. Christina is a freelance writer, works from home. She needs dedicated office space with good natural light (she's specific about this!)
4. Dealbreakers: no pools (safety concern with kids), must have AC, prefer not right on a main road

January 2nd at 2pm EST works great for a call. Should I send you a Zoom link or do you have a preferred platform?

One other thing - our timeline is tight because we have to be out of our rental here by Feb 28. Ford covers temporary housing but Christina would really prefer to avoid that with two kids. Is closing by end of February realistic?

Victor

Victor,

Great info - this helps a lot!

For schools: Troy School District and Rochester Community Schools are both excellent. Troy is ranked in the top 10 in Michigan, and Rochester has strong gifted programs. Both would serve your daughter well.

For Christina's office: Noted! We'll prioritize homes with a dedicated room that could work as an office - ideally with south or west facing windows.

No pool, AC, not on main road - got it.

Closing by Feb 28: Tight but doable IF we find the right house during your trip and get an accepted offer. That gives us about 7-8 weeks to close, which is normal. The key is being prepared:
- Get fully pre-approved with a lender (not just pre-qualified)
- Have earnest money ready to go
- Be decisive when we find the right house

I'll send a Zoom link for Jan 2nd at 2pm EST. In the meantime, I'll pull listings that match your criteria so we can narrow down before you arrive.

Talk soon,
Dave

Dave,

Happy New Year!

Attached is our pre-approval letter - we're good up to $575k which gives us some cushion. Christina and I have been browsing Zillow and these are some houses we want to see:

1. 4521 Brookdale Dr, Troy - $529k (love the kitchen!)
2. 892 Thornwood Circle, Rochester Hills - $515k (great yard)
3. 1847 Wilshire Blvd, Troy - $495k (seems like a good deal?)
4. 6723 Meadowbrook Lane, Rochester - $545k (Christina loves this one)

Can we schedule showings for these plus anything else you recommend?

Also - do you have lender recommendations? We're working with someone in Texas but Ford's relocation coordinator suggested using a local lender might be faster.

Looking forward to the call tomorrow!

Victor

Victor,

Happy New Year to you too!

Good choices on those listings - I'll schedule showings. A few notes:
- Brookdale Dr: Beautiful home, I know this one. Kitchen was renovated 2022.
- Thornwood Circle: Great neighborhood. House backs to a small park.
- Wilshire Blvd: Listed low because it needs some work - roof is older. Could be opportunity or could be headache.
- Meadowbrook Lane: Hot listing, may have offers already. I'll check.

I'll add 2-3 more options based on what I'm seeing in the market.

For lenders - yes, local is better for tight timelines. I recommend Jennifer at Movement Mortgage (248-555-0189). She's closed dozens of Ford relocations and knows how to move fast.

See you on Zoom at 2pm!

Dave

Victor
