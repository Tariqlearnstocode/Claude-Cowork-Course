**Dave (2:47 PM):** Great showing today! I could tell Maria really loved the Maple house. Let me know what you're thinking - remember there's another showing Monday so timing matters.

**James (3:15 PM):** Yeah she's definitely interested. I need to run the numbers again tonight. That's at the top of our budget.

**Dave (3:18 PM):** Totally understand. Happy to walk through the financials with you. The sellers are motivated - might have some room on price.

**James (3:22 PM):** Good to know. We're having dinner with Maria's parents tomorrow - they want to see it. Can we do a showing Sunday afternoon?

**Dave (3:25 PM):** Absolutely! I'll set it up. Does 2pm work?

**James (3:31 PM):** Perfect. Thanks Dave.

**Dave (3:30 PM):** James - wanted to give you one more heads up on Maple. If you're still interested, now would be the time. If your situation has changed, no worries - just let me know either way.

**Subject:** Maple house and our situation

Hi Dave,

I'm sorry James hasn't been responding to your messages. We've been dealing with some family stuff (his mom had a fall and we've been at the hospital a lot).

I still love the Maple house but James is getting cold feet about the price. He's worried about stretching our budget, especially with his mom potentially needing more care.

Is there any chance we could see if the sellers would come down on price? Like to $395k instead of $415k? I know that's a big ask but it might help James feel more comfortable.

If that's not possible, I understand. I just don't want to lose this house but I also don't want to put us in a bad financial position.

Thank you for being patient with us.

Maria

Maria,

I'm so sorry to hear about James's mom - I hope she's recovering well.

I completely understand the budget concerns. Here's my honest assessment:

The Maple house is listed at $415k and there's been good interest. I don't think the sellers will go to $395k, but they might entertain something in the $405-408k range if we came in with a strong offer (good earnest money, quick close, minimal contingencies).

Would that make a difference for you and James? If so, I can reach out to the listing agent and test the waters before we submit anything formal.

Also - if Maple isn't the right fit, that's okay. Your first house should feel right, not stressful. There are other options in your price range.

Let me know what you'd like to do.

Best,
Dave

## Property Notes (from showing)

**2847 Maple Street, Royal Oak - $415,000**
- 3BR/2BA, 1,650 sq ft, built 1952
- Updated kitchen (2019), original hardwood floors
- Nice backyard with mature trees
- Basement finished (extra living space)
- 2-car detached garage
- Walk score: 72 (good)

Maria: "I can see us living here. The kitchen is exactly what I wanted."
James: "It's nice but... is it $415k nice? That's a lot."

Listing agent: Mike Tran (same Mike from Greenfield listing)
Showing activity: High - multiple groups through over the holidays

**My assessment:** Good house, fair price for the area. Hendersons could probably get it for $405-410k if they move fast. But they're hesitating and hesitation kills deals.
