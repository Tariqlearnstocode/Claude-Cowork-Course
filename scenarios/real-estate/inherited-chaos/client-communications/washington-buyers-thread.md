**December 10, 2024**

**Dave (2:15 PM):** Hi Robert, this is Dave Kowalski from Lakefront Realty. Got your inquiry about Royal Oak/Berkley. I'd love to help! When's a good time for a quick call to discuss what you're looking for?

**Robert (3:45 PM):** Hi Dave! Great to hear from you. I can talk tomorrow afternoon, maybe 2pm?

**Dave (3:48 PM):** Perfect. I'll call you at 2pm tomorrow. In the meantime, can you forward your pre-approval letter so I can verify your budget?

**Robert (4:12 PM):** Sure, will email it tonight. Looking forward to talking.

**Dave (2:03 PM):** Robert, I just tried calling - went to voicemail. Give me a ring back when you're free!

**Robert (2:15 PM):** Sorry! Got pulled into a meeting. Can we do 4pm?

**Dave (4:05 PM):** Great chat! To summarize: you and Denise are looking for 4BR in Royal Oak or Berkley, budget up to $485k (per your pre-approval), good schools for the kids, and Denise needs space for a home office since she works remotely. I'll pull some listings and we can set up showings for this weekend. Sound good?

**Robert (4:12 PM):** Sounds perfect. Saturday works best for us. The kids can stay with grandparents.

**Dave (4:15 PM):** Great! I'll send options by tomorrow and we'll nail down a schedule.

**December 12, 2024**

**Dave (11:30 AM):** Robert, sent you an email with 5 listings to review. Let me know which ones you want to see Saturday. I'm thinking we start at 10am?

**Robert (12:45 PM):** These look good! Denise really likes #2 and #4. Let's do all 5 though. 10am works.

**Dave (12:50 PM):** You got it. Showings confirmed for Saturday. I'll send the schedule.

**December 14, 2024 (Saturday - showing day)**

**Robert (8:15 AM):** Dave - bad news. Denise woke up really sick. Stomach flu or something. No way we can do showings today. I'm so sorry.

**Dave (8:20 AM):** No worries at all - health first! Let's reschedule. How does next weekend look?

**Robert (8:25 AM):** Next weekend is Christmas so probably not great. Maybe the week after? Like Dec 28 or 29?

**Dave (8:30 AM):** That works. Let's tentatively say Saturday Dec 28. I'll check in mid-week to confirm. Hope Denise feels better!

**Robert (8:35 AM):** Thanks Dave. Sorry again. We're really motivated so don't give up on us!

**December 23, 2024**

**Dave (10:00 AM):** Hi Robert! Hope Denise is feeling better. Still on for Saturday Dec 28 showings?

**Robert (11:45 AM):** Hey Dave - so Dec 28 is tricky because Denise's parents are in town. Could we do Jan 4 instead? First Saturday of the new year?

**Dave (11:50 AM):** Jan 4 works! Let's lock it in. I'll refresh the listings since a few have gone pending.

**Robert (11:55 AM):** Perfect. Thank you for being flexible. We'll be ready to move fast when we find the right one.

**[No response]**

**December 30, 2024**

**Dave (9:30 AM):** Robert, just following up - still good for Jan 4? Need to confirm by tomorrow so I can schedule everything.

**Robert (12:15 PM):** Yes! Sorry, holidays have been crazy. Jan 4 is confirmed. Denise is excited to finally get out there.

**Dave (12:20 PM):** Great! I'll send the confirmed schedule by Wednesday.
