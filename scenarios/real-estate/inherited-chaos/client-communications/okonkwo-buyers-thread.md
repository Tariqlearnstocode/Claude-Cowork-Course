**Subject:** Inspection report concerns - URGENT

Dave,

We just got the inspection report for the Redford house and there are some serious issues:

1. **Roof** - Inspector says it has 2-3 years left max. Estimate to replace: $12,000-15,000
2. **Foundation** - There's a crack in the basement wall. Inspector recommends further evaluation. Could be nothing or could be $5,000+
3. **Electrical** - Panel is outdated, not up to code. $2,000-3,000 to update

This is a $195k house and we're looking at potentially $20k+ in repairs. We can't do this. We need the sellers to either fix these issues or give us a credit.

What are our options here?

Chidi,

I reviewed the inspection report - I understand your concerns. These are significant items.

Here's my recommendation: Let's request a repair credit rather than asking sellers to do the repairs. This gives you control over the work and lets you hire contractors you trust.

I suggest we ask for $15,000 credit - that covers the roof (most urgent) and electrical. For the foundation crack, we can request a structural engineer evaluation at seller's expense before deciding if it's a real issue.

Want me to draft the repair request?

Dave,

Yes, please draft the request. $15k credit sounds right to us. And definitely need that foundation looked at by an engineer.

One question - if they say no, can we walk away? I don't want to be stuck with this house if they won't negotiate.

Ada is really stressed about this. We saved for 3 years to buy our first house and this was supposed to be exciting, not terrifying.

Chidi,

Yes - your inspection contingency protects you. If we can't reach agreement on repairs, you can terminate the contract and get your earnest money back. We have until December 20 to resolve this or exercise that right.

I'll send the repair request today. Tell Ada not to worry - this is what the inspection period is for. We'll figure it out.

**Subject:** 3847 Beech Daly - Repair Request

Lisa,

Attached is the repair request from my buyers (Okonkwo) for the Beech Daly property.

In summary:
- $15,000 credit at closing for roof replacement and electrical panel update
- Seller to pay for structural engineer evaluation of basement wall crack
- If structural evaluation reveals significant issues, parties will negotiate in good faith

Inspection report is also attached. I think this is a reasonable request given the findings.

Let me know what your sellers say.

Thanks,
Dave

Dave,

My sellers reviewed the request. They're not happy.

Their counter:
- $8,000 credit (they'll split the difference on the roof, won't address electrical)
- No structural engineer - "the crack has been there for 20 years and never been a problem"

They also pointed out that this is a 1955 house priced accordingly. Buyers should expect some age-related issues.

What do you want to do?

Chidi,

Sellers came back with $8,000 credit - no structural evaluation.

I think this is too low. I'm going to counter at $12,000 plus the foundation inspection. Let me know if you disagree.

Dave,

$8k is insulting. Counter at $12k but we NEED that foundation looked at. No inspection, no deal.

Ada says if they won't budge on the inspection, we walk. She doesn't want to buy a house and find out it's sinking.

Let me know.

**Subject:** RE: 3847 Beech Daly - Counter

Lisa,

Counter from buyers:
- $12,000 credit
- Structural engineer evaluation required (seller expense)

The foundation inspection is a dealbreaker for my buyers. Without it, they'll exercise their inspection contingency.

Dave,

Sellers will do the structural evaluation but they're firm at $8k credit.

That's their final offer. Take it or leave it.

**Subject:** Where we stand

Chidi,

Sellers agreed to the structural evaluation but won't move past $8k credit.

We're $4k apart. Here are your options:
1. Accept $8k and move forward
2. Counter at $10k and see if they'll split the difference
3. Walk away

My advice: The structural evaluation is actually the more important concession. If the foundation is fine, $8k toward the roof is something. You'd be getting the house for $187k net ($195k - $8k).

What do you want to do?

Dave,

Ada and I talked about it all night. Counter at $10k. If they say no, we're out.

We've been looking for 8 months and we're exhausted, but we won't overextend ourselves for a house with problems.

Let us know.

**Subject:** 3847 Beech Daly - Final Counter

Lisa,

Buyers counter at $10,000 credit + structural evaluation. This is their final number.

We're $2k apart from making this work. Can your sellers come up?

Inspection contingency deadline is December 20.
