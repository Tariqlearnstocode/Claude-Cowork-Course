**Subject:** Looking for a home in Birmingham area

Hi Dave,

You were recommended by our friends the Sharmas who you helped buy their house last year. We're looking to buy in the Birmingham/Bloomfield area, ideally in Birmingham schools for our two kids (ages 9 and 6).

Our budget is around $400,000. We need 4 bedrooms and would prefer a house that doesn't need major work since we don't have time for renovations.

We're pre-approved and ready to start looking whenever you have time.

Thanks,
Raj Patel

Raj,

Great to hear from you, and please thank the Sharmas for the referral!

I'll be honest with you upfront: Birmingham schools with 4 bedrooms at $400k is a challenging combination right now. The Birmingham school district commands a premium, and most 4BR homes there are listing closer to $500k+.

That said, let me do some digging. There are a few strategies we can explore:
1. Look at the edges of the district where prices are lower
2. Consider homes that need some cosmetic updating (but no major work)
3. Look at Beverly Hills or Bingham Farms (different schools but still excellent)

Would you be open to any of these approaches? Let's schedule a call to discuss.

Best,
Dave

Dave,

Thanks for the honest feedback. We're definitely committed to Birmingham schools - that's the main reason we're moving. My wife Priya is a doctor and her schedule is crazy, so we need the schools to be excellent since she can't be as involved.

We could potentially stretch to $425k if we found the right house. And we're okay with some cosmetic work - just no major systems or structural stuff.

Let's do a call. I'm free most evenings after 7pm once the kids are in bed.

Dave,

Priya and I talked after the showings yesterday. We're getting frustrated.

We've now seen 8 houses since October and nothing fits. Either it's too small, or it needs too much work, or it's in the wrong part of the district, or it's over budget.

The Woodward Heights house was beautiful but $425k is already stretching us and they wanted $425k. We can't go higher.

I'm starting to wonder if what we want even exists. Is $400-425k for a move-in ready 4BR in Birmingham schools just not realistic?

What should we do?

Raj

Raj,

I hear you, and I understand the frustration. Let me be straight with you:

What you want IS challenging in this market. Birmingham schools at your budget typically means:
- Smaller (3BR) homes, OR
- Homes that need updating, OR
- The absolute edge of the district

I see a few paths forward:

**Option 1: Increase budget to $450k**
This opens up significantly more inventory. I know it's a stretch, but it might be the only way to get what you want.

**Option 2: Accept a 3BR**
There are nice 3BR homes in your budget. Could the kids share a room, or could you convert a basement/bonus space?

**Option 3: Consider adjacent districts**
Beverly Hills (Birmingham schools but lower prices), Bingham Farms, or even parts of Troy or Bloomfield Hills schools. All excellent options.

**Option 4: Wait**
Spring inventory is usually better. If you're not in a rush, we could pause and revisit in March.

I don't want you to settle for something that doesn't work. Let's talk about which of these options might make sense for your family.

Dave,

Priya and I discussed. She's not willing to compromise on Birmingham schools or the 4 bedrooms (we need a guest room for her parents who visit often).

She wants to talk about increasing the budget. Can we do a call this week to discuss what $450k opens up?

Raj,

That's a productive conversation to have. Let's schedule a call for this week.

How about Thursday at 8pm after the kids are down?

In the meantime, I'll pull listings in the $425-450k range so we can discuss what's out there.
