**Subject:** Quick question about closing date

Hi Dave,

I know we're still a few weeks out, but I wanted to confirm - we're still on track for January 10th closing, right? My landlord needs to know when I'm moving out and I have to give 30 days notice.

Also, the lender sent something about final documents - should I be doing something with that?

Thanks!
Jennifer

Jennifer,

Yes, Jan 10 is still the target! Go ahead and give your landlord notice.

Forward me what the lender sent and I'll take a look.

Happy holidays!
Dave

Hi Dave,

Here's what they sent - something about employment verification? I think they need something from my HR department but I'm not sure what exactly.

Also my dad asked about the title insurance - is that something I should be looking at or does the title company handle it?

Thanks and happy holidays to you too!
Jennifer

Hi Dave,

Hope you had a nice Christmas! Just following up on my questions below - I haven't heard back and I want to make sure I'm not holding anything up.

The lender called yesterday and said they're still waiting on employment verification. I'm confused about what I need to do.

Let me know when you have a chance!

**Subject:** Getting worried - please respond

Dave,

I really need to hear from you. It's been almost two weeks and closing is January 10th.

The lender says they're missing:
1. Updated employment verification (I don't understand why they need another one)
2. Some document from you about the inspection repairs

I've given notice to my landlord. My parents are flying in to help me move on the 11th.

Please call me.

**Subject:** URGENT - Closing in 8 days

Dave,

This is really frustrating. Closing is in 8 DAYS and I have no idea what's happening.

I called your office and someone named Linda said you were "out of pocket" and would call me back. That was yesterday.

I've been a patient person through this whole process but I'm starting to wonder if I made a mistake working with Lakefront Realty.

If I don't hear from someone TODAY I'm going to have to escalate this to your broker.

Jennifer,

I apologize for the delayed response. You're right to be frustrated.

I've confirmed with the lender what they need:
1. Employment verification - they need a verbal VOE from your HR. I'll send you the contact instructions.
2. The inspection repair verification - I'll coordinate with the sellers agent to get the receipts for the roof repair they agreed to.

We should be fine for Jan 10. I'm sorry for the stress.

Dave
