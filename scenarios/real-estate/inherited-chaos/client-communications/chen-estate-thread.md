**Subject:** Listing my father's house - referral from Peter Hartman

Mr. Kowalski,

Peter Hartman gave me your name. He said you handled the estate sale for the Morrison family last year and they were very pleased.

My father, George Chen, passed away in October. We're now at the point where we need to sell the family home in Bloomfield Hills (47892 Woodward Hills Dr). The house has been in our family since 1984.

This is difficult for our family, as I'm sure you understand. My brother David and I want to handle this thoughtfully but also efficiently. We're both professionals with limited time, and the house has been sitting empty for two months now.

Can we schedule a time to meet and discuss?

Best regards,
Helen Chen
Attorney at Law

Helen,

Thank you for reaching out, and I'm very sorry for your loss. Peter is a good friend and I'm honored he thought of me for this.

I understand what you're going through. Estate sales require a delicate balance - respecting the memory and meaning of a home while also being pragmatic about the market and your needs as a family.

I'd be happy to meet with you and David to discuss the process and answer any questions. I can also provide a comprehensive market analysis so you know what to expect.

Are you available this week? I could do Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.

Warmly,
Dave Kowalski

Dave,

Thank you for the thoughtful response. Friday morning works - would 10am at the house be okay? My brother is in Chicago but he can join by video call.

A few things you should know:
- The house is a 5BR colonial, about 4,200 sq ft
- It needs updating - my parents hadn't done major renovations since the 90s
- There's still furniture and personal items in the house (we're slowly clearing it out)
- David wants to price high ("it's Bloomfield Hills, someone will pay"). I'm more realistic.

Looking forward to meeting you.

Helen

Helen,

Friday at 10am works perfectly. I'll bring my market analysis and we can walk through the house together.

I appreciate you being upfront about David's expectations. I find it's always better to have those conversations early. My job is to give you accurate data so you can make informed decisions - not to tell you what you want to hear.

See you Friday!

Dave

Dave,

Thank you for meeting with us today and for walking through the house. Your knowledge of the Bloomfield Hills market is clear, and I appreciated your honesty about the condition of the property.

To summarize what we discussed:
- You believe the house would list in the $1.1M - $1.2M range
- The kitchen and bathrooms need significant updating
- Comparable sales suggest $1.15M is a reasonable starting point
- We could potentially get more if we made improvements first, but you don't recommend this for an estate sale

David, I know you were hoping for a higher number. Dave explained why $1.3M+ isn't realistic given the dated finishes. I think we should trust his expertise here.

Dave - what are next steps? When can you send the CMA and listing agreement?

Helen

Helen,

I hear what you're saying but I'm not ready to just accept $1.15M. This is DAD's house. He bought it for $380k in 1984. The land alone has to be worth more than what Dave is suggesting.

Dave - no offense, but can you show me what houses actually SOLD for on Woodward Hills? Not listings. Sales. I want to see the data before I agree to anything.

Also, I talked to a realtor friend in Chicago and he said we should definitely list higher and negotiate down. That's standard practice.

David,

No offense taken at all - you should absolutely see the data before making a decision. I'll put together a detailed CMA (Comparative Market Analysis) with recent sold properties on Woodward Hills and the surrounding area. I'll have it to you early next week.

Regarding the "list high and negotiate down" strategy - that works in some markets, but in Bloomfield Hills right now, overpriced homes sit. Buyers in this price range are sophisticated and they do their homework. A house that sits for 90+ days gets stigmatized. I've seen it happen.

But let's look at the numbers together and make a decision based on data. That's all I ask.

Dave,

Happy holidays! Hope you had a good Christmas.

Just checking in on the CMA. David is eager to see the numbers (I think he's coming around on price but wants to feel like he did his due diligence).

We're hoping to list in mid-January if possible. The house is costing us money every month just sitting there.

Also - I've started clearing out more of the furniture and personal items. The house should be showable by early January.

Thanks,
Helen

Helen,

Thanks for following up. I'll have the CMA to you by Monday (Dec 30).

Mid-January listing is very doable. Once you've reviewed the CMA and we agree on price, we can sign the listing agreement and get photos scheduled. I'd recommend professional staging consultation too - even estate sales benefit from some basic staging.

Let's plan to meet the week of January 6 to finalize everything?

Talk soon,
Dave
