"Dear Jennifer,

I owe you an apology. The holidays got away from me and I dropped the ball on communication. That's not fair to you, especially when you're making one of the biggest purchases of your life.

Here's where we stand:
- Employment verification: I'm following up with your HR today
- Roof repairs: I'm contacting the sellers to confirm completion
- Closing: Still targeting January 10

I'll call you this afternoon with a full update.

Again, I'm sorry. You deserved better communication.

Dave"
