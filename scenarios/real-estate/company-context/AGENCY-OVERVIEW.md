## Office Culture

Lakefront is collaborative rather than competitive. Agents share leads, help each other with open houses, and celebrate wins together. Sandra set this tone deliberately - she believes the industry is cutthroat enough without internal competition.

That said, Dave was somewhat of a lone wolf. He was friendly but kept his business close. He didn't share much about his clients or his methods. Some of that was old-school protectiveness; some was just his personality.
