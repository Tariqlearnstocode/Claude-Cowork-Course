# Real Estate Chaos: Inheriting a Top Agent's Book of Business

## Your Role

You are **Jessica Torres**, a real estate agent at **Lakefront Realty Group** in the Detroit metro area. You've been licensed for three years, steadily building your business with 15-20 transactions per year. Today is **Monday, January 6th, 2025**.

## The Situation

Last Friday, January 3rd, **Dave Kowalski** - the office's top producer for 12 consecutive years - announced he was retiring effective immediately. His wife had a health scare over the holidays and he decided life is too short. He walked out that afternoon with a box of family photos and never looked back.

Dave didn't plan this. He didn't transition his clients. He didn't organize his files. He just... left.

Your broker, **Sandra Chen**, called you Saturday morning: "I know this is huge, but you're the only one I trust with Dave's book. He's got 47 active leads, 12 deals in various stages, and clients who haven't heard from anyone since before Christmas. I need you to figure out what's happening and save what we can."

She's transferred Dave's email access and CRM login to you. His desk is now your second workspace. The commission split on any deals you close from his pipeline: 50/50 with the brokerage instead of your usual 70/30.

## What You've Inherited

- A CRM full of leads in various stages (many with incomplete or cryptic notes)
- Email threads mid-conversation with buyers, sellers, and other agents
- A desk drawer full of sticky notes, business cards, and scribbled reminders
- 12 pending transactions in different stages - some closing this month
- Showing notes from properties Dave toured with clients
- No clear system or organization - Dave kept most of it in his head

## Your Immediate Challenges

1. **Identify the urgent situations** - Who's about to lose earnest money? Which deals are falling apart?
2. **Reach out to abandoned clients** - Some haven't heard from their agent in 2-3 weeks
3. **Figure out what's actually happening** - Dave's notes are incomplete and sometimes contradictory
4. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - You can't save everything. What matters most?
5. **Keep your own clients happy** - You still have your own business to run

## What You Know About Dave

Dave Kowalski was a legend. 400+ transactions over his career. "Kowalski Sells Detroit" was his tagline. He knew every neighborhood, every school district, every inspector and lender in the metro area.

But Dave was old school. He resisted the CRM for years - Sandra finally forced him onto it in 2022, but he never really used it properly. He kept notes in a spiral notebook, on napkins, on the back of listing sheets. Important details lived in his head.

He was also a classic "relationship guy." Long lunches with clients, handwritten birthday cards, showing up at closings with champagne. His clients loved him. They also expected a lot of hand-holding.

Now they have you.

## The Stakes

These are real people making the biggest financial decisions of their lives:

- First-time buyers who've been searching for months
- Families relocating for jobs who need to close by specific dates
- Sellers who already bought their next house and need this one to sell
- Investors with money on the line
- People going through divorces, deaths, life changes

Every day that passes without contact erodes trust. Some of these clients will fire the agency. Some deals will fall through. Your job is to minimize the damage and salvage what you can.

## Key Contacts

- **Sandra Chen** - Your broker (available by phone, wants daily updates)
- **Marcus Webb** - Transaction coordinator (handles paperwork, knows the deals)
- **Linda Park** - Office manager (knows where things are, Dave's filing system)
- **Dave Kowalski** - Unreachable. Sandra tried calling; he's not picking up.

## A Note on the Mess

Dave wasn't incompetent - he was actually brilliant at his job. But his system only worked because it all lived in his head. Without him, his files are a puzzle with missing pieces. Names without context. Amounts without properties. Dates without explanations.

Your job is to be a detective, a therapist, and a salesperson all at once.

*Take a deep breath. Open his files. Start making calls. You've got this.*
