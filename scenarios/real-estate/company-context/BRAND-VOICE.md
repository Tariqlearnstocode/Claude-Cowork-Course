# Lakefront Realty Group - Brand Voice Guide

## Who We Are

Lakefront Realty Group is a mid-sized independent brokerage serving the Detroit metro area since 1987. We're not a national franchise - we're local people who live in the communities we serve. Our agents know the neighborhoods because they're our neighborhoods too.

## Our Voice

We communicate with **confidence, warmth, and expertise**. We're professionals who genuinely care about our clients' outcomes - not salespeople pushing transactions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Expertise Without Arrogance

We know this market deeply, and we share that knowledge generously. But we never talk down to clients or make them feel stupid for asking questions.

- **Say:** "Great question - here's what I've seen in similar situations..."
- **Not:** "Well, obviously the market conditions indicate..."

- **Say:** "Let me walk you through the inspection report"
- **Not:** "This is standard stuff, don't worry about it"

### 2. Honest, Even When It's Hard

We tell clients what they need to hear, not just what they want to hear. A house that's overpriced won't sell. A neighborhood with issues needs honest discussion.

- **Say:** "I want to be straight with you about the comps in this area"
- **Not:** "We'll just list high and see what happens"

- **Say:** "I've seen some concerns with this property that we should discuss"
- **Not:** "Everything looks great, let's put in an offer!"

### 3. Responsive and Reliable

Real estate moves fast. We return calls. We follow up. We don't leave clients wondering what's happening.

- **Response time standard:** Same business day for all communications
- **Update frequency:** At least weekly during active transactions
- **Availability:** We're reachable, but we also respect boundaries

### 4. Local Pride

We love Detroit. We believe in its neighborhoods. We don't apologize for the city or its challenges - we celebrate its strengths and speak honestly about its opportunities.

- **Say:** "Ferndale has incredible walkability and the restaurant scene is amazing"
- **Not:** "It's not as bad as people think"

- **Say:** "This neighborhood is in transition - here's what that could mean for values"
- **Not:** "It's up and coming" (vague) or "Stay away" (dismissive)

## Tone by Context

### First Contact with New Leads
- Warm, curious, helpful

### During Negotiations
- Professional, measured
- Advocate firmly without being aggressive
- Keep emotion out of written communications

### Difficult Conversations

## Communication Channels

### Email

- Share confidential information inappropriately

## Sample Language

### Initial Outreach (Taking Over)
> "Hi [Name], this is Jessica Torres from Lakefront Realty Group. I'm reaching out because I'll be handling Dave Kowalski's clients while he's away. I know transitions can be frustrating, so I want to make this as smooth as possible. I've reviewed your file and I'm up to speed on where things stand. Can we schedule a quick call so I can introduce myself and answer any questions you might have?"

### Update When There's Nothing to Report
> "Hi [Name], just checking in. I don't have any new updates yet, but I wanted you to know I'm actively working on [specific action]. I'll be in touch as soon as I hear anything. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions."

### Delivering Difficult News
> "I need to share some news that isn't what we were hoping for. [State the facts clearly.] I know this is disappointing. Here's what I recommend we do next..."
