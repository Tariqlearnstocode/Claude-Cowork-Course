# Competitor Research: Mama Rosa's Kitchen

## Overview
**Type:** Single-location neighborhood favorite
**Positioning:** Family-owned, personal touch
**Our Overlap:** Same Royal Oak neighborhood, similar comfort food focus

## Their "Loyalty Program"
**Name:** They don't really have one
**Approach:** Relationship-based loyalty

### How It Works
- No app, no points, no tiers
- They just... remember you
- Regulars get occasional free desserts
- Birthday? They know and surprise you
- "Your usual?" is their technology

### What They Do Well
1. **Personal Recognition** - Staff knows regulars by name
2. **Surprise & Delight** - Random free desserts for loyal customers
3. **Word of Mouth** - Customers tell stories about being recognized
4. **Authenticity** - No corporate loyalty program, just genuine care

### Their Weaknesses
- Doesn't scale beyond one location
- No data capture
- Inconsistent (depends on staff memory)
- Can't compete on convenience

## What We Can Learn
- Personal recognition is POWERFUL
- Surprise rewards beat predictable points
- Stories spread (people tell friends about personal treatment)
- Technology should enhance relationships, not replace them

## Key Insight
Mama Rosa's has the most loyal customers in Royal Oak with ZERO technology. People feel KNOWN there. That feeling is what drives loyalty, not points.

Quote from a Yelp review: "I've been going to Mama Rosa's for 10 years. They know my order, my birthday, my kids' names. No app could ever replace that."

## The Big Takeaway
Points don't create loyalty. Feeling KNOWN creates loyalty. How do we use technology to help people feel known, not just tracked?

## The Big Question
Can we capture what makes Mama Rosa's special but scale it to 3 locations? What if our app helped staff remember customers instead of just tracking points?
