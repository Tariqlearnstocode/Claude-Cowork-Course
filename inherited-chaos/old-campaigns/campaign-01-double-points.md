# Campaign: Double Points Weekend

**Status:** Ran twice, mixed results
**Last Run:** February

## Concept
Double points on all purchases during a weekend promotion.

## Details
- Friday 6am - Sunday 9pm
- All purchases earn 2x points
- Promoted via email, push, in-store signage

## Results
- 23% increase in app scans during promo
- Returned to baseline within 3 days
- Cost: ~$800 in accelerated rewards liability
- No measurable impact on 30-day retention

## What Happened
People came when there was a deal, then went back to normal. We basically paid more for the same behavior.

## Assessment
Not worth repeating. This is the "discount treadmill" - you have to keep running promotions to maintain baseline activity. Doesn't build real loyalty.

## Notes
- Maybe pair with something else?
- Or make it more exclusive (VIP members only?)
- Problem: doesn't address WHY people don't engage
