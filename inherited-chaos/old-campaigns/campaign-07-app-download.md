# Campaign: App Download Bonus

**Status:** Current (always running)
**Started:** Program launch

## Concept
Bonus points for downloading and registering in the app.

## Details
- 25 bonus points on app registration
- Promoted via in-store signage
- Servers encouraged to mention it

## Results
- ~130 downloads per month from this campaign
- But only 31% of downloaders make a second transaction
- 69% download, get bonus, never engage again
- Cost-per-engaged-member is high

## What Happened
We're paying for downloads, not engagement. People sign up for the bonus, then forget about us. The app doesn't give them a reason to come back.

## Assessment
This is the core problem with our whole program. We're incentivizing sign-ups, not engagement. The app itself has nothing compelling to return to. Checking your points balance isn't a reason to open an app.

## Notes
- Stop paying for downloads?
- Or make the app worth opening?
- What would make someone WANT to open the app?
- Games? Content? Personalization?
- Or something simpler - like knowing your food personality?
