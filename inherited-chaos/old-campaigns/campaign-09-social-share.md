# Campaign: Social Share Bonus

**Status:** Ran once, disaster
**Last Run:** February

## Concept
Bonus points for sharing State Fair content on social media.

## Details
- Share our post → screenshot → show server → get 20 bonus points
- Tried to create viral moments
- Valentine's Day themed

## Results
- 12 total redemptions
- Awkward process (showing phone to server)
- Some customers felt embarrassed
- Staff found it annoying to verify
- Created 0 organic engagement

## What Happened
Nobody wants to spam their friends for 20 points. And the process was clunky. People felt like we were using them for marketing instead of rewarding them for loyalty.

## Assessment
Total failure. This is the worst kind of "engagement" - forced and transactional. Real social sharing happens when people genuinely love something and want to share it. You can't buy that with points.

## Notes
- Learned: don't pay for fake engagement
- If people aren't sharing organically, forcing it with points doesn't work
- Need to create something worth sharing, not pay people to share nothing
- What WOULD people genuinely want to share about us?
- "I just found out I'm a Comfort Food Classic!" - that's shareable
- "I earned 20 points at State Fair today" - nobody cares
