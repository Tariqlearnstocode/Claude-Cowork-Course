# Campaign: Happy Hour Points Boost

**Status:** Ran once, abandoned
**Last Run:** March

## Concept
3x points during slow afternoon hours (2-5pm) to drive traffic.

## Details
- Monday-Thursday, 2-5pm
- 3x points on all purchases
- Promoted via push notifications at 1:30pm

## Results
- 8% increase in afternoon traffic during promo week
- 34% of push notifications were immediately dismissed
- Some customers complained about notification timing
- No sustained behavior change after promo ended

## What Happened
The notifications felt spammy. The 8% lift wasn't worth the customer annoyance. One customer replied to our email: "Stop texting me to eat lunch."

## Assessment
The timing gimmick doesn't address the core problem. People aren't avoiding afternoons because of points - they're just not thinking about us at all.

## Notes
- Maybe useful for specific locations with afternoon slumps?
- Need better notification strategy in general
- This is a band-aid, not a solution
