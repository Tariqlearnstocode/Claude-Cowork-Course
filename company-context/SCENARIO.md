# Your Situation

## The Company: State Fair Cafe

State Fair Cafe is a beloved local restaurant with **3 locations** across Detroit and the surrounding area (Downtown Detroit, Dearborn, and Royal Oak). Founded in 2016, the restaurant has built a loyal following by focusing on:

- Classic American comfort food with a Michigan twist
- A gathering place for families and friends (not just quick meals)
- Supporting local farmers and suppliers
- A warm, nostalgic vibe (think: the neighborhood spot where everyone feels at home)

The restaurant is surviving but struggling. With rising costs and competition from chains, leadership is looking for ways to deepen customer relationships and increase visit frequency.

## The Loyalty Program

Six months ago, leadership launched **State Fair Rewards** - a points-based loyalty program. The hope was to:

1. Increase visit frequency (from 1x/week to 2x/week for regulars)
2. Capture customer data for personalized marketing
3. Compete with chain restaurant loyalty programs (Applebee's, Chili's, etc.)
4. Turn casual visitors into committed regulars

**The problem:** The program isn't working as expected.

## Your Role

You're the **new manager** at State Fair Cafe. You were hired to bring fresh energy to the restaurant and tackle some of the problems that have been piling up. You've got a lot on your plate - operations, team management, customer experience - but one urgent priority keeps coming up: the failing loyalty program.

The previous manager left things in a mess. Among the chaos you inherited:
- A folder full of messy notes, half-finished campaign ideas, and scattered data
- A loyalty program with okay sign-up numbers but terrible engagement
- Leadership who's skeptical ("We've invested $25K in this - where are the results?")
- A deadline: **3 months to turn the loyalty program around, or leadership is considering killing it**

## The Stakes

If the program fails:
- $25K investment wasted
- Customer data goes unused
- Competitive disadvantage vs. chain restaurants
- Your reputation takes a hit (you didn't create the problem, but you own it now)

If you can turn it around:
- Prove yourself as someone who can take on tough problems
- Build something that actually helps the business
- Potentially expand your role

## Your Goal

Over the next few hours, you're going to use Cowork to:

1. **Make sense of the chaos** - Analyze what you inherited
2. **Understand the problems** - What's actually going wrong?
3. **Find solutions** - What do successful programs do differently?
4. **Build something** - Create a prototype that could save the program

By the end, you'll have real skills AND a real deliverable.

Let's get started.
